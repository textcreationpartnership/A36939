            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Indeed, its the <hi>miſery of moſt,</hi> that they are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to this <hi>truth.</hi> To ſpeak to many of <hi>the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and to tell them <hi>of a life in love, above what ſence feels, and of a comfort, a glory, a happineſſe flowing from thence, far ſurmounting what ſight fees,</hi> is a <hi>myſtery,</hi> which they cannot <hi>perceive</hi> (nor indeed <hi>beleeve</hi>) for tis <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi> unto them.

               <hi>wee are unto God, by ſo much the nearer we come up to perfection.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge is exceeding precious:</hi> It muſt needs be ſo, ſith it tends to perfection. Indeed, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith of ſeeing, <hi>Though the object of ſight be mean in it ſelf, yet the very act of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſweet:</hi> So alſo hee determines of Knowing, that however the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be low and poor, yet the very act it ſelf of knowledge, is high and precious.</p>
            <p>Now of <hi>all knowledge there is none ſo precious, nor ſo perfecting, as that which is Divine.</hi> Other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>(viz. Human)</hi> can make us perfect only as <hi>men:</hi> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>(viz. Divine)</hi> gives us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as Saints. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of all Divine knowledge, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt in the light of love, as moſt precious,</hi> as tending moſt to the perfection of our ſouls: As ther are degrees of luſtre in the heavenly lights; ſo there are degrees of glory in Divine truths. Every Star in the Firmament hath a glorious light; but yet the light of the Sun exceeds them all in glory: And every truth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100935:10"/>(which is as a <hi>Starre in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Divinity</hi>) hath a peculiar excellency in it, and the knowledge thereof is precious: But Jeſus Chriſt (who is as the <hi>Sunne in Divinity's heaven</hi>) hath a tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in him;. and to know him, doth ſarre more tend to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of our ſouls, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any, or all Divine truths elſe beſides. Therefore it is that <hi>Paul</hi> accents this knowledge with an <hi>excellency,</hi> Phil. 3.8. <hi>Yea doubtleſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paul</hi> might well ſay thus: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had attained the knowledge of other things, yet without this, he had been at a loſſe in point of Soul-ſacred perfection. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other knowledge (as being ſome way perfecting and precious) be deſirable; yet there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is ſo to be deſired (at leaſt by Saints) as the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100935:11"/>
            <p>But yet, as although the <hi>Sun</hi> be the moſt glorious of the <hi>heavenly Lights,</hi> yet Mortals receive more comfort by its <hi>heat,</hi> than by its <hi>light:</hi> In like manner, though the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt bee the moſt tranſcendent of divine truths, yet our ſouls receive more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the <hi>warmth of his love,</hi> than by the <hi>luſtre of his light.</hi> Look as <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſee the <hi>glory of God and live,</hi> and yet muſt <hi>dye except he ſaw his grace:</hi> Even ſo our ſouls cannot ſee the <hi>luſtre of the bright beams of Chriſts glory, and live</hi> (wee muſt dye ere we can behold that) yet notwithſtanding we muſt <hi>ſee the light of the boſome-love of Jeſus, or elſe we dye.</hi> If this light dawn not upon our boſoms, if this knowledge ſhine not into our hearts, we ſhall ſink and dye in our ſouls, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if wee are in fear of any troubles.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> among the reſt of thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Petitions, which he puts up to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100935:11"/>the <hi>Father of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> in the behalf of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> leſt they ſhould <hi>faint at his tribulations,</hi> hee adds this, that they might know <hi>the love of Chriſt which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhal briefly give you the <hi>context,</hi> that it may give ſome light to the <hi>text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle having hinted in the firſt verſe of this Chapter,<note place="margin">Context.</note> that hee was a priſoner of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who were <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo upon that ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the excellency of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>warrant</hi> which hee had to preach the ſame unto them (which two things were as two great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of him in his ſufferings) hee comes in the fourteenth verſe to pray for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they might not <hi>faint at his tribulations.</hi> Now there might be a double ground of the Apoſtles fear, why the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might faint at news of his tribulations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Sympathy.</hi> It is uſual with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100935:12"/>Saints to ſympathize each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their tribulations. And <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ground, might rightly think, that the tidings of his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment would be ſad to theſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians;</hi> and happily he might fear, that out of their tender love, both to his perſon, and preaching, they would be over-ſad, by ſympathy, to underſtand, that now their Preacher was in priſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Fear leſt themſelves might meet with the like ſufferings.</hi> For what might they think? Is <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon for <hi>Preaching the Goſpel?</hi> then ſure may we fear the like for <hi>receiving the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is commonly ſeen, that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of Goſpel-truths ſuffer as well as the revealers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> And certainly (the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might ſay) we ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as faulty for our faith in, as <hi>Paul</hi> is for his Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. This peradventure they might argue, and fear, and faint; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle bendeth his knees to him who alone is able to keep
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100935:12"/>from, and ſupport in faintings, <hi>i. e. To the Father of our Lord Jeſus:</hi> And three things he beggeth in the behalf of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they might not (upon any ground) faint at his tribulations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Divine ſtrength.</hi> That he would grant according to the riches of his glory, <hi>that they might be ſtrengthned with might by his Spirit, in the inner man,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>The ſpirit of man</hi> (the Apoſtle knew was weak, and ſo would faint, unleſs God did ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it; therefore he begs the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (which is the <hi>power from on high</hi>) for their ſtrengthening in the inner man, that they might not faint in their outward man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Chriſts inhabitation.</hi> That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>If any thing will keep up the heart from fainting,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of Chriſt with the ſoul.</hi> Chriſts preſence creates comfort, and there is no ſuch fence againſt faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any fears, as Chriſt in the ſoul. The inhabitation of Chriſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100935:13"/>within, will ſupport the ſoul from its faintings at tribulation for Chriſt without.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>The knowledge of Chriſts love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That they might know <hi>the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> as it is in the text. <hi>Paul</hi> well knew the power of Chriſts love, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof this way. So that now you may gather up the Apoſtles Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions into one Prayer, and you may conceive him pouring out his heart after this manner:

                  <hi>Thou Father of our Lord Jeſus, ſith thou art the God of all comforts, and comforteſt thine in all their tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that they faint not; vouchſafe to grant according to the riches of thy grace, that the</hi> Epheſians <hi>may not faint at my tribulations. And to this end, ſtrengthen them by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of power in their inner man; fill them by the glorious preſence of Chriſt dwelling in them; but above all, let them know the love of Jeſus Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee by the <hi>Context,</hi> the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100935:13"/>drift and ſcope of the <hi>Text.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeak any further to it, I muſt clear one thing, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily may be an occaſion of doubt, and that is the <hi>ſeeming unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this part of</hi> Pauls <hi>prayer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doubt.</note> For may ſome ſay, what reaſon is there that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould pray for that, which he hints is impoſſible? Why ſhould he pray that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might know that, which he expreſly ſaith was above knowledge? <hi>The love of Chriſt which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There bee three things which may ſatisfie this ſcruple,<note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the reaſonableneſſe of this requeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Admit the love of Chriſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove knowledge, yet 'tis not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to deſire to know it. For look, <hi>as albeit the fulfilling of Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts be above our power, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is to be in our endeavour. In like manner, albeit the knowledge of Chriſt, of Chriſts love, though its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our intellectuals, yet it may bee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100935:14"/>in our deſires,</hi> The ſame infiniteneſs, which Grace puts in the Will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it endeavour to fulfill that, which it cannot; nay, yea and doth alſo put on the deſire for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that which cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2 To know the love of Chriſt may be ſaid to be above know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with reference to men, as men; not unto Saints, as ſuch. Indeed the <hi>ſpirit of man</hi> is not able to know, or ſearch into the love of Chriſt (that is above its knowledge:) But the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> is able both to ſearch into, and to reveal his love. And though <hi>Chriſtians as men,</hi> cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, by the <hi>light of reaſon,</hi> yet as <hi>Saints</hi> by the <hi>light of faith</hi> they may; eſpecially the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (in the mean time) <hi>ſhedding it abroad in their hearts,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The love of Chriſt may be ſaid to be above knowledge, <hi>in regard of its perfection of degrees, not ſimply inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100935:14"/>
            <p>'Tis true, the perfect knowledge of Chriſts love paſſeth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of men, and Angels (which is its glory:) But yet in <hi>ſome meaſure</hi> it may be known (the which is our duty.) For that which cannot bee known <hi>perfectly</hi> (in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) may yet be known <hi>partially,</hi> (and in ſome meaſure.)</p>
            <p>Thus the Text may bee cleared from the doubt propounded. Now there are four ways in which I ſhall look upon this Scripture, and ſo ſpeak unto it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>As it includes the truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſts love to the Saints.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diviſion of the word.</note>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>As it concludes the height, and royalty, or tranſcendency of that love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>As it holds out the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the</hi> Epheſians <hi>might know both.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4 <hi>As it contains the ground of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the</hi> Epheſians <hi>hearts from fainting at</hi> Pauls <hi>tribulations;</hi> which is the drift and ſcope that <hi>Paul</hi> drives, or aimes at in them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And thus there will be four Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100935:15"/>which I ſhall take up, and ſpeak unto from theſe words.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>There is love in Chriſts boſome towards all beleevers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doctrines from the words.</note>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>That love which Chriſt bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to beleevers, is a tranſcendent love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>It is a thing of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for every Chriſtian to know the tranſcendent love of Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>The Spiritual knowledge of the tranſcendent love of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Beleevers, is of ſpecial efficacy to keep up ther hearts from fainting under any trouble.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might more fully be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from another Text, yet becauſe it will be a good foundation for the following Diſcourſe, and is clear enough in this place, I ſhall briefly ſpeak unto it now, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is love in Chriſts boſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is clearly (couched at leaſt) in theſe words; <hi>Science</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>ens; Paul</hi> would not doubtleſſe pray that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might know
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100935:15"/>that which was not; things muſt be, ere they can be known.</p>
            <p>Nothing falls under the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, till it firſt bee in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly open the Point,<note place="margin">Point o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnened.</note> and then prove it, and apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How love may be ſaid to be in Chriſt.</note>How love may be ſaid to be in Chriſt (as any other affection) I ſhall not need to inquire; though happily love may bee ſaid to be in Chriſt as God (for as hee is man there is no doubt of it) in far more proper ſenſe, then any other paſſion may, becauſe it is (as it were) his eſſence, <hi>God being</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> ſaith) <hi>love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What Chriſts love is.</note>What the love of Chriſt is, I ſhall not curiouſly define. The <hi>Moral'ſts</hi> have ſo many <hi>definitions</hi> of love, that indeed it is hard among them (as the Proverb) is, <hi>to finde this wood for trees,</hi> i. e. to know what <hi>love</hi> is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their various definitions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Paſſing by therefore their nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I ſhall content my ſelf with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100935:16"/>this plain deſcription of love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the commanding affection of the Soul,<note place="margin">Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> conſiſting in the expanſion or going out of the heart, towards a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or thing, in wiſhings and workings for its good.</hi>

Love is <hi>Queen regent in the Soul,</hi> and it ſits upon the Throne commanding all. It is the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the boſome, and hath the ſame power over all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which the <hi>Centurion</hi> hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his ſervants.</p>
            <p>I ſay, it conſiſts in the <hi>expanſion or ſtretching out of the heart.</hi> Look, as hatred contracts and gathers in, ſo love opens and dilates the heart. I adde, that it conſiſts (in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) in <hi>wiſhings and workings for good.</hi> I do not ſpecifie the end, for that deſcribes, and denominates the particular kinds of love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only in the general, I ſay, it conſiſts in the going out of the heart, in wiſhing and working for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100935:16"/>the good of the perſon, or thing loved.</p>
            <p>So that now, when I ſay that there is love in Chriſts boſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all beleevers, I mean, that <hi>the commanding affections of Jeſus Chriſt is ſet upon them; that his heart is open, and ſtretched out unto them; and that the wiſhings and workings of his Soul are towards them for good.</hi>

            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100935:17"/>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 13.23 &amp; 19.26</note> and of him it is often ſaid, he was <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple whom Jeſus loved:</hi> yea and <hi>John</hi> will witneſs for more than himſelf, He ſaith Jeſus loved him, and all Beleevers beſides him: For ſpeaking to them he ſaith, <hi>He</hi> (i. e.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> I. The point <hi>informs us of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt to all the Saints.</hi> O how ſweet! how kind! how gracious! is Jeſus Chriſt to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, thus to minde then, thus to ſet his heart upon them? Beleevers, the Lord loves you, Is he not in this ſweet unto you? <hi>Ruth</hi> at the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Roaz</hi> his love, falleth on her face, and faith, <hi>Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldeſt take knowledge of me, ſeeing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100935:22"/>I am a ſtranger?</hi> Fall on your faces Beleevers, you were once <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, but you have found <hi>grace in his eyes;</hi> your names are written upon his heart in letters of love: well may you ſay that Chriſt is ſweet, ſeeing he loves ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as you were. The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſurely ſweet in ſetting his love upon you, who were ſtrangers unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> O how happy art thou, O poor beleever, in being the object of thy Lords love! The meaneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever may raiſe up a very <hi>high ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of happineſſe,</hi> upon this <hi>corner ſtone,</hi> Chriſts love. O how bleſſed art thou in thy beloved (poor ſoul!) and how ſweet is hee to thee! that hath alway a fire of love burning in his boſome towards thee?</p>
            <p n="2">II. This point is very <hi>comfortable</hi> to beleevers; It is a <hi>cordial</hi> to you, is it not, O beleever! that Chriſt doth love you? doth it not revive your hearts (my brethren) to hear, that hee who is the Lord of Life, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100935:23"/>glory in himſelf, is a Lord of grace and love to you? Jeſus Chriſt who <hi>hath written upon his Garments, Lord of Lords,</hi> hath alſo <hi>written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his boſome, love to beleevers.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (Beleevers) could you but ſee how near you are to Chriſt, how highly he prizeth you, how dearly he loves you; I ſhould not need to bid you rejoyce, or be glad, or be of good comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> No, will the ſoul ſay, Indeed you need not, <hi>if I could but ſee that Chriſt loved, me, but I doubt that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſ.</hi> Doubt it not (O beleeving ſoul) but be <hi>confident,</hi> and in that confidence bee <hi>comforted:</hi> Chriſt loves you, and that (as wee ſhall ſhew hereafter) with a <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it is good to have a ground of confidence; and in vain ſhall you comfort me, if I ſee no reaſon in your words. <hi>Why what reaſon is there that Chriſt ſhould love mee?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100935:23"/>
            <p>Reſ. <hi>Chriſts love is its own reaſon.</hi> He therefore loves becauſe he will. It may be the vanity of our wanton love, that we love meerly becauſe we love: But it is the glory of Chriſts love, that he doth ſo.<note place="margin">☜ Mark and mind this.</note> 
               <hi>The reaſon why Chriſt loves thee</hi> (O poor ſoul) <hi>is in his own boſome. If thou look in thine, thou wilt not finde it</hi> (becauſe it is not there) <hi>but look up into Chriſts boſome,</hi> and there it is. <hi>He will have mercy upon whom he will.</hi> Chriſt will love thee, and doth love thee (O Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) becauſe <hi>he will.</hi> Do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand queſtioning <hi>why he ſhould,</hi> but be comforted, and rejoyce in this, <hi>that he doth love thee,</hi> even <hi>thee</hi> (O poor ſoul.) Though it may bee thy faith be little, yet Chriſts love to thee is true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But though he love me now, will he love me ſtill? <hi>Will not Chriſt diſlike me hereafter, and upon that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like deſert me? Sure I am I ſhall give him cauſe, and I fear he will take it. And certainly if Chriſt deſert, I dye, I cannot live longer than I have his love</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100935:24"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Neither dye, nor doubt, poor ſoul! Thy Lord ſo loves thee, that he will not leave thee; or if he do for a time, he will not alway. <hi>Chriſts</hi> ☞ <hi>bowels burn with love, and that fire, however ſmothered for a time, will break out in a flame at laſt.</hi> Chriſts love is like himſelf, immutable and unchangeable. <hi>Love is Chriſts life as well as thine:</hi> He will not ſurely kill himſelf by deſerting thee. Thou canſt not live except Chriſt do love, neither can Chriſt. You Lord hath ſworn <hi>(and ſurely if he break his oath he dyes)</hi> that the Mountains ſhall be removed, but his love ſhall not leave thee.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Oh! But though Chriſt do love me, yet men hate me.</hi> I cannot be ſo cheerful in Chriſts love, becauſe I meet with the creatures wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> I pity thee poor Creature, thou haſt the <hi>love of the Potter,</hi> and thou feareſt the wrath of the <hi>Potſherd.</hi> Why art thou ſo weak, as to ſink under the <hi>Creatures wrath,</hi> while thou haſt the <hi>Creators love?</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100935:24"/>Be of good comfort, Chriſt can break in peeces all thy enemies with his <hi>Iron rod,</hi> while in the mean time he will comfort thee with his <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds-crook.</hi> Why doſt thou droop at the hatred of him, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in a Tabernacle of clay, and not rather <hi>triumph</hi> in the love of him, who is <hi>ſet down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high?</hi> Look up Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, Heaven is clear over thy head, though the earth be dirty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet; though thou be in a <hi>ſtorm</hi> among the creatures, yet the <hi>Sun of love</hi> ſhines on thee from Chriſt. He ſmiles and loves thee, what though men frown and hate thee? Fear not him who hates thy body, and at worſt can but deſtroy that; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce rather in him who loves thy ſoul, and at the laſt will raiſe up thy body from the Grave, and give thee a glorious body like unto his own, and fill thy ſoul with eternal joy in the enjoyment of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love.</p>
            <p>The laſt uſe of the point is-for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100935:25"/>
               <hi>counſel.</hi> Sith Chriſt loves his Saints, I would (ſurely the point might, and doth) counſel, both <hi>the world,</hi> and <hi>beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, you <hi>men of the world; If you have an ear to hear, hear: Chriſt loves beleevers, be yee counſelled to do the like.</hi> Certainly Chriſt will take it well at your hands, if you love them who are beloved by him. His friends are ſometime ſtrangers in your Land, uſe them well, ſhew them love, put it upon Chriſts ſcore; he loves them, and he will reward you: Jeſus Chriſt doth ſo love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as that he will not let a <hi>cup of cold water, given to them in his name,</hi> (that is, becauſe hee loves them) go unrewarded. I ſay it again, ſith Chriſt is gracious, and loves belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, be ye wiſe and love them alſo. However, <hi>take heed that yee do not wrong them.</hi> If you will not do them good, beware you do them no hurt: Beleeve it, if you do, Chriſt loves them, and he will not bear it. Tremble, leſt, (while you lift up
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100935:25"/>your hand againſt beleevers) that Jeſus Chriſt who loves them, daſh you in peeces. Beware of <hi>perſecuting Chriſts beloved ones under pretences.</hi> It will be but a poor excuſe, to ſay they were <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> Chriſt knows them to be <hi>Saints:</hi> Beleeve it, the bloud of beleevers is very precious, and as he will puniſh Antichriſtian wretches, <hi>under what names, or titles ſoever diſtinguiſhed;</hi> So alſo will he be avenged upon all thoſe who dare touch beleevers, under what <hi>nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names ſoever diſgraced.</hi> Therefore if you will not be ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> as to <hi>love;</hi> yet be not ſo <hi>mad,</hi> as to <hi>hurt</hi> thoſe <hi>whom Chriſt loves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>let this counſel belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> ſith the Lord Jeſus loves them, that they would <hi>walk worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Beleevers, live as the objects of Chriſts love; <hi>Advance his Kingdom, imbrace his counſels, love all his members, be abundant in his work, and ſervice.</hi> In all things ſhew that Chriſts love to you hath a conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power in you; at leaſt be <hi>yee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100935:26"/>counſelled to love Chriſt, who loves you</hi> and that ſo much the rather, becauſe Chriſt deſerves thy love, though thou do not deſerve his. O let not the love of Chriſt plead againſt you, and ſay, I ranne out to them, but they returned not in to me. Let not Chriſt ſay, I gave you counſel, and you did reject it; In love I gave you Commandements, and you did tranſgreſſe them. No, but ſith Chriſt loves you, love him; and if <hi>you love him, keep his Commandements.</hi> Rouſe up your ſelves, O beleeving ſouls! and conſidering that Chriſt loveth you, demean your ſelves according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If he <hi>call, come;</hi> If he <hi>bid</hi> you go, <hi>go;</hi> If his Kingdom be advancing, joyn in the work (<hi>it is the Kingdom of him that loves you</hi>) If his Spirit <hi>counſel, take</hi> it (for it comes from love.) In a word, in all things live as thoſe who indeed are <hi>beloved of Chriſt.</hi> And let your carriage be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obedient, kinde,</hi> and <hi>loving unto him,</hi> who doth ſtoop ſo low, as to love ſuch poor creatures as you be.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100935:26"/>And if any ask, why you love, and labour for Jeſus Chriſt? tell them, it is becauſe you love him: And adde withall, that did they but know how Chriſt loves you, they would rather ask; why you love him ſo little, or do for him no more. But if they demand, <hi>how doth</hi> Chriſt love you? Tell them, that queſtion is unanſwerable. Indeed ſay, he <hi>loves</hi> you and that <hi>truly;</hi> but withall <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently.</hi> That Chriſt loves you, tell all the world of <hi>you know;</hi> but <hi>how</hi> he loves, tell them, that <hi>paſſeth your knowledge:</hi> yea and the knowledge of every creature, for it is a <hi>love paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing knowledge.</hi> And this is the next thing, and the chief thing which we ſhall ſpeak of.</p>

            <p>Having briefly touched at the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> of Chriſts love to beleevers (as it is included in this place) I ſhall now ſpeak more largely to the <hi>royalty</hi> thereof (as it is ſet out in this phraſe) that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi> Whence our ſecond point was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That love which Chriſt beareth to beleevers, is a tranſcendent love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee how fully this point lies in theſe words. It muſt needs bee <hi>tranſcendent,</hi> ſith the Apoſtle ſaith, it <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall indeavour to open the point, and give you the meaning thereof, by bringing you to the

               <hi>top</hi> of this <hi>high hyperbolical</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in three ſteps or ſtaires.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The love of Chriſt to Beleevers is tranſcendent, it being above expreſſion.</hi> Thoſe who enjoy Chriſts love, they know not how to expreſſe it, ſuch is the <hi>tranſcendency</hi> of the love, that it <hi>paſſeth their knowledge</hi> how to expreſſe it in any Language. The Scripture ſets out the height of things by this, that they are <hi>unſpeakable:</hi> So when it would heighten, and declare the tranſcendency of that <hi>rapture</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> was (when wrapped up to the third heavens) and the glory of that which he then heard, it ſets it down by this, that it was unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>He heard unſpeakable words,</hi> (which may be an Hebraiſm for things, <hi>word</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> being in the Hebrew convertible) <hi>which it was not poſſible for a man to utter,</hi>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100935:28"/>phraſe, that it was unſpeakable, 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Yee rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it muſt not be paſſed by in ſilence, that the joy of which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, is that which Beleevers have by faith, which certainly is founded upon Chriſts love; So <hi>that if the joy in the faith of Chriſts love be unſpeakable, the love it ſelf is much more:</hi> For <hi>quod efficit tale, eſt magis tale</hi> (as the Logicians ſpeak) i. e. <hi>That which makes any thing ſo, or ſuch, is much more it ſelf ſo, or ſuch.</hi> This may be the firſt ſtep to aſcend the height of the expreſſion, and to declare the tranſcendency of Chriſt love to beleevers, <hi>It paſſeth knowledge</hi> in this, that no man (no, though he had the <hi>tongues of men and Angles</hi>) knows how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Chriſts love is tranſcendent, and may be ſaid to be above knowledge, in that it is above apprehenſion.</hi> As the Language of Beleevers cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, ſo neither can their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100935:29"/>apprehend the height of their Saviours love.

The Holy Ghoſt, when hee would ſet out a thing as tranſcendent, he uſeth this phraſe, that it is ſuch as <hi>cannot be comprehended.</hi> As now, ſpeaking of the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things which God

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, as the <hi>operation of the Fathers hand, ſo the expanſion of the Sons heart,</hi> is ſuch, as <hi>cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this, the <hi>Fathers works,</hi> and the Sons <hi>loves,</hi> do equally tranſcend, that they <hi>paſſe knowledge,</hi> and are not able to be apprehended.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſt bears to beleevers a tranſcendent love, &amp; it <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> in this, that it is above concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fancy can conceive that which Reaſon cannot comprehend. The Underſtanding being bounded by Reaſon, cannot go beyond its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; and therefore where Reaſon cannot ſuggeſt, the Underſtanding cannot apprehend. But now fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is winged, and it will fly: It doth (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare caeterorum finium praeſcriptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, It ſcorneth to be bounded, though by Reaſon it ſelf:</hi> It flyeth high, and will gueſſe (at leaſt) at the tranſcendent height of that which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100935:30"/>reaſon cannot reach. Yet ſuch (my beloved) is the love of Chriſt; It is ſo <hi>high,</hi> ſo <hi>ſuperlatively-tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> that let fancy looſe, and let it <hi>fly</hi> as high as it can, it is not able to <hi>ſoare</hi> to the <hi>top</hi> thereof. As the underſtanding going to its utmoſt bounds: So <hi>fancy flying</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all bounds, is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what is the love of Chriſt to Beleevers.</p>
            <p>So that now when I ſay, the <hi>love which Chriſt Bears to Beleevers is tranſcendent,</hi> and when you read in the text, that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> You may take the meaning thus; That it is above the <hi>expreſſion of the fineſt</hi> Oratory, <hi>the comprehenſion of the deepeſt</hi> Theory, <hi>and the conception of the ſublimeſt</hi> Fancy; In ſo much, as let <hi>Oratory</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſtudy, <hi>Fancy</hi> fly, yet neither the one, nor the other, nor all, are, able to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, apprehend, or conceive</hi> what is the love of Chriſt to beleevers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the love of Chriſt is ſuch, as heaven it ſelf <hi>(though it be the state
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100935:30"/>of ſight)</hi> doth not (as hereafter we ſhal ſhew) exalt the Saints ſo high, as to make them able to comprehend that love, in the <hi>fields</hi> whereof they do <hi>walk</hi> and live. It is with the Saints in Heaven, as with the Fiſhes in the Sea; they ſwim up and down the mighty waters, but yet they do not, cannot comprehend that <hi>watry world</hi> in which they live: In like manner, the Saints above, though they <hi>ſwim</hi> up and down the <hi>infinite Ocean of love</hi> (which is in their Saviours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom) yet they can no more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that vaſt <hi>ſea of love,</hi> in which to eternity they ſhall bathe, and bleſſe their ſouls, than the little <hi>Fiſh</hi> can comprehend the <hi>great Sea</hi> in which it ſwims. Wherefore (ere I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further) let me premiſe this, That it is not in my thoughts, nor dare I preſume this, neither would I have you expect, that by any thing which I ſhall or can ſay, I ſhall be able to ſet out the <hi>infiniteneſs of that love</hi> (of which we ſhal treat) according to his full Latitude, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100935:31"/>worth. No, this I deſpair of; only I deſire to let you ſee ſome of the glimmering beams of that <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love</hi> which is in Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome towards beleevers, ſo as that you may wonder at it, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the exacter ſtudy of it. And look as a <hi>Painter,</hi> when he intends to draw out the <hi>Sea,</hi> or the World in a <hi>Map,</hi> hee maketh only ſome <hi>little ſhadows</hi> of the Earth and Sea, that ſo the beholder may be inabled to gueſſe at the vaſtneſſe thereof: In like manner I ſhall <hi>draw</hi> before you (in my Diſcourſe) ſome <hi>little ſhadowy pricks,</hi> or <hi>lines of Chriſts love,</hi> that thereby I may help you ſomewhat to imagine, what is that <hi>infinite tranſcendent love,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints nor Angels are able (in all its luſtre and dimenſions) to <hi>paint out</hi> or diſcover.</p>
            <p>For the proof, I ſhall not need to adde more Scriptures, it being clear enough by what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks in this place of Chriſts love, that it is tranſcendent. In
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100935:31"/>the verſe before this, the Apoſtle hints, that there are all the <hi>dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> in Chriſts love, which may ſerve to declare any thing vaſt and infinite. There is a <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>height</hi> in the love of Chriſt. And it is worth the noting, the Apoſtle doth not tell <hi>how great</hi> thoſe dimenſions were; He doth not ſay <hi>how broad,</hi> or <hi>how long,</hi> or <hi>how deep,</hi> or <hi>how high;</hi> but (as if the dimenſions of Chriſts love did tranſcend his knowledge) he paſſeth it by, and only adds this, <hi>that this love paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde not this phraſe (to my beſt remembrance) but once more in the New Teſtament, and that is <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.7. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the tranſcendency of the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it paſſeth underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Certainly, it is the glory of <hi>Chriſts love</hi> (as well as of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers peace</hi>) that it alſo <hi>paſſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If at your leaſure you read, and reading <hi>ſpiritually conſider,</hi> what is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100935:32"/>preſented to <hi>faith,</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> you will ſee this truth (that the love of Chriſt to beleevers is tranſcendent) in the glory and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing power,</hi> and <hi>proof</hi> thereof. It may be in your time you have <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent</hi> ſome hours in reading of ſome <hi>Romances,</hi> And you have wondred at ſome ſtrange Stories of Love which you have met withall: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! ſhould you compare the higheſt love that ever you read of, with the love of Chriſt to Beleevers, you wil be forced to confeſs; that that love, in compariſon of this, is but like the <hi>ſtory</hi> it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> a meer <hi>fancy.</hi> If ever ſtrength of affection were ſet out in ſweetneſs of expreſſion, It is in that Book to a Spiritual eye: when I do but conſider the fourth Chapter only of that <hi>Song,</hi> I cannot chuſe but wonder at the high tranſcendency of Chriſts love to beleevers. Surely I conclude, the <hi>affections are ſweet, ſtrong, glorious, unconceivable,</hi> when the <hi>expreſſions</hi> thereof are ſo <hi>raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſo great, ſo <hi>high,</hi> as in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100935:32"/>
            <p>I ſhall give one general demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, to let you ſee the truth of the Doctrin, that Chriſts love to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers is tranſcendent: The demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration take thus;
<q>That love which includeth in it, and comprehends all kindes, acts, or demonſtrations of love whatſoever, muſt needs be a tranſcendent love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch is the love of Chriſt to Beleevers, &amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>Major</hi> is clear enough, and needs no proof. The Painter took the direct, and undeniable way to make the Picture of <hi>Minerva</hi> tranſcend, and excel all other Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when he <hi>epitomized,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all the ſeveral rays, and particular beauties that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Pictures, in that one pecce. It is upon this ground an <hi>axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome indubitable,</hi> and beyond or above Diſpute, That the <hi>Sun doth farre tranſcend in Light, any, or all the other Lights, Moon, or Stars, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe in its Light, all theirs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100935:33"/>is contained, and that in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner.</p>
            <p>All the queſtion is about the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; whether that Chriſts love be ſuch to beleevers,</hi> as that it includes and contains in it, all other <hi>kindes</hi> or <hi>acts</hi> of love whatſoever. Now this I ſhall put out of queſtion by an <hi>Induction, or enumeration of the ſeveral kindes,</hi> or acts of love.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other (how exactly I will not determine) the <hi>Moraliſts</hi> tell us of theſe four kindes of love, as the chief, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>A love of Friendſhip.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>A love of Pity.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>A love of Sympathy.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4 <hi>A love of Complacency.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>In theſe four only, I ſhall inſtance <hi>(which I had rather call ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, or degrees of one and the ſame paſſion of love, than particular kindes diſtinct)</hi> and ſhall ſhew that Chriſts love to Beleevers, includes, and contains in it all of them, and that therefore it muſt needs be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100935:33"/>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>The love of friendſhip</hi> is ſo called (not as if it were the <hi>habit of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> it ſelf, but) becauſe it is that kinde, or <hi>act of love, whereby we proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute or follow one, whom we look upon, and love as a friend; and to whom we wiſh good.</hi> Now this <hi>kinde</hi> (or rather <hi>degree</hi>) <hi>of love,</hi> is in the <hi>love of Chriſt to beleevers;</hi> Chriſt looks upon, and loves all beleevers as <hi>friends;</hi> hence it is, that he counts, and calls them all by that name, <hi>ye are my friends,</hi> Joh. 15.14. And that this is real, appears by his dealing with them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added, <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants; for the ſervant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what his Lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of the Father, I have made known unto you,</hi> ver. 15. Thoſe whom we love as <hi>friends,</hi> wee open our minds unto; and it is their privilege, wee communicate to them ſecrets which we have heard. Chriſt dealeth thus with beleevers, and thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth not he declare to them the <hi>love of friendſhip?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:100935:34"/>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The love of pity.</hi> This falleth in, and followeth upon the former; for (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) <hi>To him that is afflicted pity ſhould be ſhewed by his friend,</hi> Job 6.14. This alſo is included in Chriſts love to beleevers. For upon that <hi>love of friendſhip</hi> which he bears to them, he acteth this of <hi>pity</hi> ſtill towards them; when <hi>no eye pitied them, his eye did.</hi> When ſinners, and Satan rather <hi>laugh</hi> at their miſery, and ſay, <hi>Aha, Aha, ſo would wee have it.</hi> Chriſt he as it were <hi>ſighs</hi> to ſee their ſorrows, and indeed <hi>pities</hi> their ſouls: Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In his love, and in his pity hee redeemed them</hi> (it was real pity it did work) <hi>and he bare them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the days of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>The love of Sympathy</hi> (which in truth is but a <hi>high degree of pity</hi>) is alſo contained in the love of Chriſt to beleevers. Men <hi>ſympathize</hi> with thoſe whom they love; when they do (as it were) take up their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries upon themſelves, and be as if they were in their Friends caſe.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100935:34"/>Thus doth Jeſus Chriſt, when hee ſees any beleever groan either under ſin, or ſadneſs, he comes, and by a <hi>ſympathy</hi> doth <hi>afflict himſelf</hi> (For in all their afflictions (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>he was afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 63.9.) as if he himſelf was in their ſadneſs, and under their ſin. The Author to the Hebrews tells us, <hi>Wee have not an high Prieſt who cannot</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> i. e. <hi>ſympathize with our infirmities,</hi> cha. 4.15. His meaning is, that indeed our <hi>high Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt, doth ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize</hi> with beleevers in their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. And in Chap. 5.2. it is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he can have compaſſion of the ignorant;</hi> that word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and it ſignifies as much as, Hee knoweth how to pity according to the meaſure of our miſery. Let the miſery be never ſo great (for with reference to great <hi>meaſure</hi>) I beleeve the Metaphor is uſed) Jeſus Chriſt knows how to <hi>meaſure</hi> out as great a <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>ſympathy,</hi> as is needful. So that Chriſts love to Beleevers you ſee contains in it alſo the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100935:35"/>
               <hi>love of ſympathy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, For the love of <hi>complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> (which indeed is the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love) this alſo is in Chriſts love contained. You have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency (and a demonſtration alſo of the thing in hand) <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God</hi> (which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of Chriſt) <hi>in the middeſt of thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">God is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours in Chriſt. Chriſt is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>God with us,</hi> or <hi>our God.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>is mighty, he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with joy: he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> It is the nature of the love <hi>of complacency to reſt in its ſelf,</hi> and to rejoyce in its lettings out unto its object, as it were with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus doth Chriſt to beleevers: He firſt loves them, and then <hi>reſts</hi> in that love, and after ſolaceth himſelf in their ſouls, &amp; rejoyceth with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while he reſts in his love, with them, over them, in them. Look as the Father did from all eternity, by his <hi>love of complacency, reſt</hi> in the Son, and took his delight in him, as it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. So doth Jeſus
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100935:35"/>Chriſt reſt in beleeverss, and he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth himſelf in their perſons; for as it is there added, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>His delights were in the ſons of men.</hi> Thus doth Chriſts love to beleevers (you ſee) comprehend in it this higheſt <hi>kinde,</hi> (or rather <hi>degree</hi>) of love, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>complacency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that (now to wind up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration) Look as the <hi>Sea</hi> doth tranſcend all other <hi>Rivers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they all come, and empty themſelves into it: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> excel all loves whatſoever, and is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; In as much as all the <hi>kindes, acts,</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of love which run up and down among the creatures, (as it were in ſeveral Chanels) do all <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>empty themſelves in Chriſts boſome,</hi> as into <hi>the vaſt ocean of love,</hi> and thence <hi>flow forth</hi> into <hi>the boſomes of Beleevers,</hi> as the ſole choyce peculiar <hi>Ciſterns</hi> of the ſame: great, high, tranſcendent love.</p>
            <p>But becauſe my deſign is a little
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100935:36"/>to <hi>loſe my ſelf</hi> in this Diſcourſe of love. I ſhall for the further making out, and diſcovery of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Speak to it more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: And at this time I ſhall touch at the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of this love, and in both, ſhew how it doth tranſcend, and paſſe all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the <hi>ſubſtance of the love of Chriſt to Beleevers:</hi> It is ſuch as if <hi>rightly</hi> (i. e. <hi>ſpiritually</hi>) conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: will appear to be <hi>tranſcendent.</hi> There are (to omit others) but four things which I ſhall touch upon briefly, as the ſubſtantial declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Hyperbolical excellency of this love.</p>
            <p>viz.
<list>
                  <item>1 <hi>The nature</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>The degrees</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <hi>The duration</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4 <hi>The operation</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> of this love.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To begin with the <hi>Nature of Chriſts love to Beleevers,</hi> It is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, it being of the ſame nature
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100935:36"/>
               <hi>that the Fathers is to him.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt loves beleevers with the ſame kind, or nature of love, with which the Father loves himſelf. <hi>His love</hi> to them, and his <hi>Fathers</hi> love to him, for <hi>nature</hi> are all one: And if there be tranſcendency in the one, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers love to Chriſt) there muſt needs be alſo in the other, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts love to Beleevers) for they are in their nature both the ſame. Chriſt himſelf bears record to this truth. <hi>As the Father hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, ſo I have loved you,</hi> Joh. 15.9. That you may fully <hi>feel the weight</hi> of this demonſtration, take it in theſe three Concluſions briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Of all love, that is the moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love which is in God.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> (as the Spirit ſaith) <hi>is love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. Water in the Fountain is the ſweeteſt, and love, in like manner, in God is cleareſt, for he is <hi>the God of love,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. Look as <hi>light in the Sun</hi> is the moſt tranſcendent; So love in God muſt needs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, becauſe <hi>love</hi> is in him, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100935:37"/>
               <hi>light</hi> is in the <hi>Sun,</hi> i. e. In its primo, and proper <hi>orbe</hi> or ſeat. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as every <hi>beam</hi> of <hi>light</hi> is but the <hi>irradiation</hi> of the Sun, ſo all the love which is in the boſomes of Creatures, is but like ſome <hi>little drops of dew,</hi> which firſt fell from the <hi>Heaven</hi> of love, Gods bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Of all the love which is in God, that is the moſt tranſcendent, which he lets out to Chriſt.</hi> It is Chriſts glory that he is <hi>crowned with the flower, beauty,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>fathers love.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was he, who is ſtill, not only the <hi>beloved,</hi> but <hi>the wel-beloved of the Father;</hi> in whom he was <hi>well pleaſed,</hi> i. e. In whom the <hi>Father</hi> did reſt in the higheſt degree of his love. And apparent it is, by all the actions of God, that he loyed Chriſt with the moſt tranſcendent kind of love. In as much as that he <hi>made all things for him, gives all things to him, and lets not out ſo much as a drop of love to any creature, but that it firſt runs into his boſome, and ſo through him to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100935:37"/>Creature.</hi> The very ſpirits and <hi>quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſsence</hi> of <hi>that love which</hi> is in Gods boſome, was let out (and <hi>that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure</hi>) into Chriſts. Now,</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>That love which Chriſt bears to beleevers, is the ſame which he had from the Father.</hi> As it flowed from the Fathers boſome into his, ſo it flows from his boſome into belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; It is the ſame love for <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>quality.</hi> As every <hi>drop</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> is the ſame for <hi>quality,</hi> that all the water in the <hi>Sea</hi> is: So every drop of love which falls in upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes of Beleevers, from Chriſts, is of the ſelf-ſame <hi>nature,</hi> and is the ſame for <hi>quality,</hi> which the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> bears to him. Indeed there is difference in the <hi>quantity.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe our <hi>Ciſternes</hi> are not ſo capacious as Chriſts <hi>Ciſtern.</hi> And yet ſo much as we can contain, we ſhall have, as I ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
            <p>So that now, herein is the firſt thing, wherein the tranſcendency of Chriſts love to Beleevers appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100935:38"/>
               <hi>It is the ſame for nature with that which the Father ſhews to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Hence it was, and is, that Chriſt both did, doth, and will, <hi>declare the Fathers name to beleevers, that</hi> (as it is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. ult.) <hi>the love wherewith the Father loved him, may be in them,</hi> as he himſelf is in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If we conſider <hi>the degrees</hi> in which, or the <hi>meaſure</hi> according to which Chriſt lets out his love to Beleevers, we ſhall ſee it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent in that alſo. <hi>Chriſt fils the boſome of beleevers with is much love as they can hold.</hi> The creature when enlarged to the utmoſt, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, neither can it contain more then they have, So that as the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the love is <hi>high;</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>degree</hi> is full. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Gods wrath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, uſeth a <hi>Metaphor</hi> in which he compares Gods <hi>wrath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine</hi> (as alſo the Pſalmiſt doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8.) and ſinners unto <hi>bottles;</hi> and ſetting out the degree of that wrath, He ſaith, <hi>every bottle is full
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100935:38"/>of wine,</hi> Jerem. 13.12. Beloved, <hi>Chriſts love</hi> is compared to <hi>Wine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. And if you compare the <hi>boſomes of Beleevers unto bottles,</hi> (as you may) then certainly know, every boſome is full of the <hi>wine of Chriſts love. The Juſtice of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is not more <hi>exact</hi> to fill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of ſinnets with his <hi>wrath,</hi> than the <hi>grace of the Son,</hi> is <hi>free</hi> to <hi>fill</hi> the boſomes of Beleevers <hi>with his love.</hi> Hence it is that he ſaith, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81.10.</p>
            <p>You read a <hi>Box of Oyntment,</hi> which when it was opened, the whole houſe was <hi>filled</hi> with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.3. ſuch a <hi>Box of Oyntment</hi> is the boſome of Chriſt, (as may bee gathered from <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. which being opened in the houſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> the hearts of beleevers, <hi>fills</hi> them <hi>[full]</hi> with the ſweet favour thereof. And indeed, as Chriſt bids beleevers ask the <hi>Father,</hi> that their joy might be <hi>full:</hi> So hee is as <hi>bountiful</hi> himſelf (as he would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100935:39"/>have his <hi>Father</hi> to be) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without their asking (for he <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth firſt</hi>) he lets out, yea and <hi>fills</hi> them with his love. In this life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have (at leaſt might) <hi>as much love as faith can let in;</hi> and if the ſoul be not full, it is only becauſe the <hi>mouth is narrow</hi> (as the <hi>bottle with the narrow neck in the Ocean;</hi>) And hereafter, as much as <hi>viſion</hi> it ſelf can <hi>ſwallow.</hi> So that now the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fulneſſe of that <hi>degree</hi> in which Chriſt lets out his love to beleevers, doth evidently declare the love to be tranſcendent alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Adde to both theſe the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>duration of Chriſts love to beleevers;</hi> and this will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtrate its tranſcendency. As the nature is high, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree full, ſo the duration is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and perpetual. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them, els</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> i. e, <hi>to the end;</hi> it may be, to the perfection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. Chriſts love is once and ever. It is of the ſame nature with himſelf, unchangeable. As no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100935:39"/>in Beleevers was ſo good as to make him to ſet his love upon them; ſo nothing is ſo bad, as doth make him take it off again. Indeed ſometime the viſible actings, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, may be concealed, but ſtill the love it ſelf remains ſure, and is never violated; That look as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, <hi>The beatifical viſion was ſuſpended, but the hypoſtatical union was not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> In like manner, though the <hi>light of Chriſts love</hi> may be for a time obſcured, yet the life thereof is ſtill preſerved. The love may be <hi>dark</hi> ſometime, but <hi>dyes</hi> never. There is nothing, no not <hi>ſin,</hi> that can totally, and finally ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſts love, and a beleevers ſoul. <hi>Paul</hi> asketh the queſtion, (to this day it is unanſwered, yea and unanſwerable) <hi>What ſhall ſeparate?</hi> Rom. 8.35. <hi>The mountains ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall be removed</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart,</hi> Iſa. 54.10. Beleevers, thoſe high Hills which you ſometimes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100935:40"/>ſee, at whoſe ſight ye wonder: And the mighty mountains which you behold ſometime, and are amazed at their vaſtneſſe; thoſe very hills and mountains not only may, but ſhall depart: But yet the love of Chriſt towards you, is ſo tranſcendently high, and ſure, that it ſhall not, nay cannot depart. So that, as the very <hi>heavens themſelves wax old like a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet the perſon of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth; even ſo ſhall heaven, earth, every creature wax old, decay, and dye; But ſtill the love of Chriſt towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, ſhall continue young, freſh, and flouriſhing:</hi> Such is its duration, ſuch ſhall be its continuance. Indeed the very life of Chriſt, muſt depart, and he dye again, ere his love to his can decay: For his love is not only the Beleevers life, but his own, (as was hinted formerly) O the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of this love, which ſhall thus laſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Conſider now in the laſt place, <hi>the operation of Chriſts love to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and you ſhall ſee its tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100935:40"/>anſwerable to its <hi>nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> and <hi>duration.</hi> We gueſſe at the tranſcendency of things by the nobleneſſe of their operations. It is a certain rule, <hi>the more noble any thing doth operate, the more noble it is in its ſelf.</hi> Love of all the affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt noble, anſwerably it hath the moſt noble operations. Chriſts love will eaſily appear to be tranſcendent, if we conſider how much more nobly it operates than any other love in the world. From the firſt point of time untill this, yea and till time ſhall be no more; the operations of Chriſts love to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, have been, are, and ſhall bee tranſcendently glorious and noble.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not in this place ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſearch into all actions of Chriſt (becauſe I ſhall more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpeak to them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to let them therefore paſſe; I ſhall only inſtance in five parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and in them you ſhall ſee the tranſcendent operations of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100935:41"/>love of Chriſt to beleevers.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>There was no condition ſo low, unto which Christ did not condeſcend, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that his love</hi> did tranſcend. High love ſtoops low; and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtill the love is, the lower ſtill it ſtoops. You may take loves elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by its condeſcention; and the lower ſtill that you obſerve love condeſcendeth, the higher alway you muſt conclude it is elevated. I think it was but a fancy, which one reporteth of a great Prince, who (it is ſaid) took upon him both the habit, and imployment of a Dayſ-man, working to build a Houſe (in which his beloved was) that he might viſit her. Yet let me tell you, it is no fancy, but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Jeſus Chriſt, that out of the height of his love to beleevers, hee took upon him both the <hi>form,</hi> and the imployment of a <hi>Dayſ-man,</hi> (which ſome think, though I do not, to be intended in that of <hi>Job</hi> 9.33.) to declare not only his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Father, but his love
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100935:41"/>to beleevers. <hi>He emptied himſelf, or made himſelf vain</hi> (for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be tranſlated) <hi>and took upon him the form of a Servant, &amp;c. Phil.</hi> 2.7. Chriſt became of no reputation, that his love to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers might bee of high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. O how nobly did Chriſts love operate towards beleevers, when he ſtooped ſo low for their ſakes!</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>There was no action ſo mean, which he did not cheerfully undertake, to declare his love to beleevers.</hi> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love doth (as it were) debaſe the Soul, to any (though the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt) ſervice, to declare it ſelf. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> will bee a Servant, and keep Sheep in the heat of Summer, and the cold of Winter, rather than not ſhew his love to <hi>Rachel.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt will waſh his Diſciples feet (a mean imployment) and though he be Lord of all, will be a ſervant unto all his Diſciples, that hee may not only teach them humility, and love one unto another, but alſo that he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100935:42"/>may declare the height and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of love unto them all.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>There is no failing ſo foul, which he doth not paſſe by, to declare the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing greatneſs of his love to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> Great love paſſeth by, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, great faults; And the greater the faults are which be committed, the greater is the love by which they are pardoned. <hi>Peter</hi> failed groſly, when he denied, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwore his Maſter: But love opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tranſcendently, when it paſſed that by. What failing more groſſe againſt the bed of love, than <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?</hi> Surely the Sons of men will not paſſe it by; this fault doth tranſcend their love: yet though men will not, Chriſt will (as it is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1.) His love tranſcends this fault. Chriſts love to beleevers is far greater, and doth much tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the love of men to their Wives, and therefore he doth that which they will not, <hi>i. e.</hi> Paſſe by the foul failing of Adultery. I take the Prophet clearly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100935:42"/>to ſpeak this of Chriſt; for it is he alone who, as it is verſe 14. <hi>is married unto beleevers.</hi> It is the glory of mans love (and then doth love operate nobly) when he paſſes by an offence: It is much more the glory of Chriſts love, and that ſhews it ſelf tranſcendently glorious in its operation, by paſſing by the groſſe, and greateſt failings which are in beleevers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>There was no gift ſo great, which Chriſt did not beſtow upon Beleevers.</hi> Love produceth gifts. <hi>Iſaacks</hi> love to <hi>Rebecca</hi> was ſeen to be great, by the great gifts he ſent her, <hi>A golden earing of half a ſhekel weight, and two bracelets of ten ſhekels weight of gold,</hi> Gen. 24.22. Chriſt gives Grace (which is far more precious than gold) to beleevers: <hi>Out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. Nay, ſo great was his bounty, and ſo large were his gifts, <hi>That he became poor for our ſakes</hi> (that was by giving) <hi>that by his poverty we might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.9. But what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100935:43"/>greater gift than himſelf? yet ſuch is the tranſcendent operation of Chriſts love, that hee gave himſelf for Beleevers ſakes, and to their ſouls.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Adde to all theſe, this alſo, that ſuch is the tranſcendent love of Chriſt to beleevers, that <hi>there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt</hi> ſo mean in them, but he highly prizeth it. Love prizes every thing in the party beloved. Chriſt doth both prize, and praiſe mean things in beleevers, becauſe his love towards them is mighty. Their <hi>voyce</hi> (though <hi>inarticulate</hi> (for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies) <hi>is ſweet,</hi> Cant. 2.10. Their <hi>love</hi> (though <hi>faint</hi>) is <hi>fair</hi> with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10. Their <hi>gifts</hi> (though <hi>ſmall</hi>) are ſo <hi>prized, that where-ever the Goſpel of his love ſhall be preached, the gifts of their love ſhall alſo be divulged,</hi> Mark 14.9. Thus you ſee all along, how tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently glorious, and noble the love of Chriſt operates towards beleevers: And what doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare but this, that <hi>the love of Chriſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100935:43"/>is indeed tranſcendent, paſſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly touched at ſome demonſtrations of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>ſubſtantially:</hi> I ſhall now adde but a word or two, to demonſtrate the ſame yet clearer, from ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>circumſtances</hi> about Chriſts love to beleevers.</p>
            <p>There be four Circumſtances, which I ſhall but mention, <hi>viz.</hi> The conſideration,
<list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Of the Perſon loving.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>Of the Perſons beloved.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <hi>Of the time of this love.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4 <hi>Of the end thereof.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider the <hi>Perſon loving,</hi> i. e. Jeſus Chriſt. He being a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Perſon, his love is like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tranſcendent alſo. <hi>Perſona eſt amoris menſura,</hi> According to the dimenſion of the Perſon, ſo are the dimenſions of the affection. The height of the lover, is the height alſo of the love. As the Moraliſts judge of the magnitude of Crimes, by the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100935:44"/>perſons againſt whom committed: So we may alſo conclude the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the love, from the greatneſs of him by whom it is declared. A little wrath revealed by God is great, becauſe he himſelf is great: And a little love let out by Chriſt, muſt be great love alſo, becauſe hee is great. Fire is by ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hotter, by how much the fuel, or matter in which it is, is the more combuſtible: Love is fire, and the flames thereof tranſcend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, according to the vaſtneſs of the boſome in which it burns. Fire in Wood makes a great flame, and gives a great heat, but Fire in Brimſtone flames more, and burns hotter; Love being in Chriſt, it is as fire in Brimſtone, or rather as fire <hi>in a Mount of Spices,</hi> it muſt needs therefore give a great heat, and make a great light; and that light will diſcover his love to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent. <hi>As the man is, ſo is his ſtrength</hi> (ſaid they of <hi>Gidcon</hi>) Judg. 8.11. <hi>As the Lord is</hi> (may we ſay
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100935:44"/>of Chriſt) <hi>ſo is his love.</hi> He is <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,</hi> and his love muſt needs bee ſo too. Becauſe wee are but little, therefore our love cannot be great; and becauſe Chriſt is great, his love cannot be little. The love of the Lord Jeſus cannot chuſe but bee tranſcendent, <hi>paſſing knowledge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe himſelf is ſuch. But</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider the <hi>Perſons beloved,</hi> and this (eſpecially joyned with the former) will indeed demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the love of Chriſt is tranſcendent. Who are beleevers, that are thus beloved? Are they of any note or name? nothing leſſe, <hi>Worms</hi> they are, and not <hi>Men.</hi> Nay not bigge, but poor <hi>Worms:</hi> For ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſtiled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.14. Hee that knoweth their frame, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth well they are but duſt,</hi> Pſa. 103.14. But this is not all: for as they are <hi>Worms,</hi> ſo <hi>worthleſs ones;</hi> and as they are but <hi>duſt,</hi> ſo <hi>defiled duſt</hi> too. Now that the <hi>rich Jeſus,</hi> ſhould love <hi>poor Jacob;</hi> That he who is ſo <hi>mighty,</hi> ſhould affect beleevers ſo <hi>mean;</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100935:45"/>That he who is ſo <hi>pure,</hi> that hee is without <hi>ſpot,</hi> or <hi>blemiſh,</hi> ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his heart to ſuch as are <hi>ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all over,</hi> and whoſe very beauty (without him) is but a blemiſh; This heightens the love indeed, this declares that it doth tranſcend. He that knows how mean, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, contemptible Creatures belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are (without Chriſt) will quickly (if he conſider that Chriſt loveth them) conclude that the love <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 If wee take into our thoughts <hi>the time of love,</hi> either when it was <hi>firſt ſet, or firſt drawn forth,</hi> we ſhall ſee by this alſo, that it is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For the <hi>beginning</hi> therefore, when it was <hi>firſt ſet,</hi> it bears date before time. Before time had either beginning, or being, Love had both, in Chriſts boſome, towards belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Chriſts love to beleevers is an antienter building than the world: for when the one had no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the other had.</p>
            <p>Surely, if (as it is <hi>Proverbs</hi> 8.31.)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100935:45"/>
               <hi>his delights, were in the Sons of men,</hi> that is, Beleevers, (for you may call all the reſt of the World, Sons of Sathan rather than Sons of men) if (I ſay) his delights were with the Sons of men, before the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the deep were ſtrengthened, or the foundations of the earth were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;</hi> Then certainly his love was alſo towards them before that time, for his love was the ground of that delight. Indeed the firſt words which Chriſt wrote, was, Love to beleevers, and this was written with glory (for it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gold was) upon his boſome, for then other Books were not. And if the love were begun <hi>time out of minde,</hi> (as we ſay) then certainly the love is <hi>paſſing knowledge</hi> (as the Text ſaith.)</p>
            <p>And for the time when it was firſt declared, The Prophet tels us, it was at ſuch a time, as in which we were moſt <hi>unlovely, when we lay in our bloud,</hi> and were not ſo lovely, as to provoke any eye to <hi>pity</hi> us:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100935:46"/>Then did Chriſt <hi>paſſe by, and it was the time of his love;</hi> and then did his love break forth with the light of Life; for then he ſaid <hi>Live,</hi> as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Surely hee did ſhew wit, who fancied the feigned beloved, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with a poyſoned hand, and made leprous thereby, and yet ſtories, that the Love was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in love as ever: But we ſhall ſhew only the truth, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if we affirm from Scripture Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, When beleevers were all poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the leproſie of ſin, and lay as Lepers by the way ſide, then Jeſus Chriſt came and took them by the hand, and opened the love of his heart, in letting out a ſtream of bloud to waſh them, and make them clean. Now, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the fountains of the deep were laid, a fountain of love ſhould ſpring up in Chriſts boſome to beleevers, and that it ſhould be opened in his <hi>ſide,</hi> at ſuch a time as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100935:46"/>they lay in their filth; What doth this declare, but that Chriſts love to beleevers is tranſcendent, and (as it is in the Text) <hi>paſſeth knowledge;</hi> it being ſet, and declared at, or in ſuch a time? Yet.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, take in the conſideration of that <hi>end</hi> which <hi>Chriſt aimes at in his love to beleevers,</hi> and this will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it alſo to be <hi>tranſcendent.</hi> Chriſts love to beleevers is its own end: <hi>He loves that he may love;</hi> and this makes the love glorious. Jeſus Chriſt (Beleevers) in all the love which hee lets out to you, aimes not at himſelf, but at you. Hee loves you now, that he may love you ever. The end which he drives at in declaring love in a leſſer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here, is, that he may declare love to you in a greater meaſure hereafter. He makes you <hi>veſſels of Grace</hi> in this world, that you may be <hi>veſſels of Glory</hi> in that which is to come. All the glory which hee aimed at for himſelf, was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and that ſhall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100935:47"/>you: Chriſt delights to ſet the <hi>golden apple of his glory, in the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver picture of your good.</hi> He being Love, only aims that men may ſee the <hi>light</hi> thereof, and he choſe your boſomes (beleevers) as the golden <hi>Candleſticks</hi> to ſet up the glorious light of his love to ſhine in.</p>
            <p>Now then, that ſo <hi>infinite a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> as Chriſt is, ſhould love ſuch <hi>mean Worms</hi> as beleevers be; And that he ſhould ſet his love before the <hi>firſt of the times,</hi> and let it out in the <hi>worst of times,</hi> and that only for <hi>their good, as the end:</hi> Oh! who can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, but muſt ſit down, and wonder, and cry out, O the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love! How! how! doth it <hi>paſſe knowledge?</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus demonſtrated a little, I would now apply this point, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in three uſes.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Let this be a word of <hi>Conviction</hi> unto ſinners. Wretches, be ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that however you ſay no body regardeth Beleevers, yet there is one who is greater than all, who regards them, and that in a high manner; know, that Chriſt loves them with a tranſcendent love. <hi>You break their ſouls in peeces, you ſlay them, and you murther them, and yet you ſay the Lord doth not ſee, neither doth the God of Iſrael regard it,</hi> Pſal. 94.7. But be convinced now to the contrary: The Lord Jeſus doth <hi>ſee,</hi> and he doth <hi>regard</hi> them; and ere long he will make you know, that (however you deal with them) they are dear unto him; though you love them not at all, yet he loves them highly. <hi>Were you not afraid</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to ſpeak againſt my ſervant</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? <hi>Num.</hi> 12.8. God wonders that they were not afraid to ſpeak againſt a man, whom he loved ſo much.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100935:48"/>And who can chuſe but wonder, that ever any wretches ſhould be ſo vile, as to ſpeak, and act againſt thoſe, cruelly, whom Chriſt loves tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently? But I pity yee (poor Creatures:) It may be you think that Chriſt ſlights them as you do; yet be convinced now, and take heed hereafter what you do; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whoever they bee, whom you oppoſe, if they be <hi>beleevers,</hi> be convinced, that the Lord Jeſus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them all with a tranſcendent love.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This Doctrin might be a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,</hi> and it counſels all to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and prize a part in the love of Chriſt, above all the loves of the world.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100935:50"/>make ſome further diſcovery of its tranſcendency.</p>
            <p>You ſee what an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth to expreſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſts love by, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt time wee gave out the meaning of the expreſſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the proof of it, in the proſecution of this point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the love which Chriſt beareth to Beleevers, is a tranſcendent love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the main thing which I eye in the Text, and indeed the main thing which every ſoul ought to eye, and live upon, I ſhall proceed further in the proſecution thereof.</p>
            <p>All which I ſpake the laſt time, for the demonſtration of the truth of the Doctrin, was but in a general way: I ſhall therefore now go on to demonſtrate the love of Chriſt to be tranſcendent, from a brief ſurvey of the courſe of his life.</p>
            <p>Indeed Chriſts <hi>Life</hi> was (as it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100935:50"/>were) but one great <hi>act of love,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at his Birth, and carried on even to the time of his Death. If we follow this <hi>Lamb,</hi> in the whole tract of his Life, we ſhall ſee, that from his <hi>Cradle,</hi> unto his <hi>Croſſe,</hi> the whole way was paved (as the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of <hi>Salomons</hi> Chariot was) with love.</p>
            <p>There be three <hi>Heads,</hi> or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which I ſhall now touch upon, that the tranſcendency of Chriſts love to Beleevers, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear yet more full and glorious.</p>
            <p>They are theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1 <hi>His Birth, and Incarnation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>His Life, and Converſation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Each of theſe ſeriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will abundantly demonſtrate the love of Chriſt to beleevers to be tranſcendent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider his <hi>Birth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.</hi> How doth Chriſts love tranſcend in this act? The low condeſcenſion of Chriſt, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>Man,</hi> doth evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100935:52"/>the high tranſcendency of his love to beleevers. Had it not been great love in the Lord Jeſus, to have taken upon him the <hi>Angelical nature?</hi> Sure it had. If Chriſt would have come into the World, with tidings of love, and life, he might have came as an <hi>Angel of glory</hi> (not as a <hi>pe ce of clay</hi>) and ſuch a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion as that had been much. But he <hi>paſſed by the nature of Angels, and took upon him the nature of man;</hi> that in this act he may declare love to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. The Apoſtle tells us, that he <hi>took not upon him the nature of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>no wiſe, at no hand,</hi> would he take upon him the Angelical Nature, but he took upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to declare his love to the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> That we may ſee a little more clearly how the love of Chriſt doth tranſcend in his birth, I ſhall ſpeak to this head in ſome particulars; and by all of them you ſhall ſee how Chriſts love unto beleevers did appear, and ſhine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100935:52"/>gloriouſly in this act of his, when he became man, and was born for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall conſider therefore particularly (under this Head) theſe four things.

            <p n="1">1 Conſider <hi>whence he came.</hi> Chriſt was in the <hi>boſome of the Father,</hi> where hee lay, and lived in his Fathers love; hence he came to declare love to beleevers. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>hee came down from Heaven,</hi> Joh. 6.38. Jeſus Chriſt from all eternity was in Heaven. There he had his Fathers company; There he enjoyed his Fathers love; There he was bleſſed in his Fathers boſome (for ſo the Scripture ſaith) he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. He was living in the light of the Fathers love: And being with God, he ſolaced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100935:53"/>in God. In that very light, and glory in which God himſelf was, in that ſame light and glory did Chriſt triumph: And yet from <hi>this,</hi> from <hi>this</hi> he came for beleevers ſakes. <hi>He forg at</hi> (as it were) <hi>his Kindred, and Fathers houſe,</hi> to bee born for beleevers. To undertake a long journey; and from a rare place, for any, doth declare much love to them; O how long a Journey did Chriſt undertake? and from what a <hi>Paradiſe of pleaſure</hi> did hee come unto beleevers, when he was born? Surely great was his affection, tranſcendent is his love, who came (at leaſt for a time) from the <hi>houſe of Love</hi> (his Fathers <hi>boſome</hi>) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Beleevers the <hi>fountain of love,</hi> (his own <hi>boſome.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="2">2 But <hi>where did Chriſt come,</hi> when he came from Heaven? was it into ſome <hi>Goſhen,</hi> ſome <hi>land of light?</hi> was it into ſome <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſome <hi>land of life?</hi> was it into ſome <hi>Elyſium,</hi> ſome <hi>place of pleaſure?</hi> Nothing leſſe. The place to which he came
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100935:53"/>was <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where beleevers <hi>ſat in darkneſſe;</hi> It was the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> where beleevers were in the <hi>ſhadow of death;</hi> It was into this <hi>World,</hi> where nothing is but <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>vexation.</hi> Here it was, that Chriſt came for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſakes: And on what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love was it, that brought Chriſt here! His eyes ſaw, that his beloved ones were in a defiled place (which therefore could not be their <hi>reſt,</hi> as it is, <hi>Micha.</hi> 2.10.) his love therefore prevailed with him to come here, to fetch his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved hence. It was great love which <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſhewed unto <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when hee came to the brink of that filthy Dungeon, in which the Prophet was, and put down cords to draw him thence: But what great love had it been, if <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> had not only come to the <hi>brink</hi> of the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> but come down into the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> and not only <hi>drew him up with ropes,</hi> but <hi>carried him up in his arms?</hi> this had been love indeed. Why let me tell
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100935:54"/>you (beleevers) you were in this <hi>World,</hi> in a worſer <hi>Dungeon,</hi> than <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was, in which you were ready to <hi>dye</hi> for hunger, and to be <hi>drowned</hi> in the <hi>mire</hi> thereof: And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came (when hee was born) not only to the <hi>brink of the Dungeon</hi> with cords to draw you up, but into the <hi>Dungeon</hi> it ſelf, to take you up in his very <hi>boſome,</hi> and to bring you out from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. <hi>I came forth from the Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) that was great love; but he addeth, <hi>I came into the world,</hi> Joh. 16.28. Here was love indeed: For Chriſt to come from Heaven (the <hi>Fathers Throne</hi>) into the world <hi>(Satans Kingdom.)</hi> For Chriſt to come from the <hi>place in which glory ſhines</hi> (Heaven,) unto a <hi>place which lies in evil</hi> (the world.) For Chriſt to come out from the <hi>preſence of the Father;</hi> who always <hi>ſmiled</hi> upon him, and to come into the <hi>place of men,</hi> who ever <hi>frowned</hi> upon him: For him to come from thence, where he always heard the <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100935:54"/>of Angels,</hi> to come here, where his ears were filled with the <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of ſinners</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! O the height, and the depth! O the breadth, and length! O the tranſcendency of Chriſts love to beleevers!</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>how came Chriſt here?</hi> Came he in pomp with glory? Came hee with the ſound of a Trumpet, that all might know, that though hee did come into a <hi>cottage,</hi> yet he was a <hi>Prince?</hi> No, but rather in a poor mean way. Indeed when Chriſt was born, <hi>an heavenly Hoaſt appeared, praiſing of God, and ſinging:</hi> But that was rather, to diſcover unto the World, that the <hi>Saints lover</hi> was come into their Country, than any way to dignifie him, who indeed was <hi>above all glory.</hi> Some expound that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.12. <hi>He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voyce to be heard in the ſtreets, &amp;c.</hi> As if it did mean, that Chriſt ſhould not carry the matter (about which he came) in an outward glorious manner, with pomp, but that in a ſilent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100935:55"/>way, he ſhould both come and do all that, unto which his Fathers love, and his own, did deſign him. And if you conſider the Hiſtory of his Nativity, you will ſay, that Chriſt came not with any <hi>great ſhow;</hi> hee was born, not the <hi>Son</hi> of ſome great <hi>Queen,</hi> but the <hi>Infant</hi> of a poor <hi>Virgin:</hi> His reputed Father was not a <hi>mighty Monarch,</hi> but a mean <hi>Carpenter;</hi> This was it, with which he was twitted in the teeth, as diſgraceful, <hi>Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Son?</hi> O how mean did Chriſt come into the World! when he was born in an Inne, and that happily none of the beſt (for there were not many Lodgings in it) and therefore his travelling Mother was fain to lye in the ſtable, and there was hee brought forth. And how did hee lye? when being <hi>ſwadled</hi> with ſome homely Cloaths, his Mother laid him in the <hi>Cratch.</hi> He that was wont to ſit upon the <hi>Throne</hi> amidſt the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> was content to bee found in the <hi>Cratch</hi> among <hi>Brutes.</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100935:55"/>Verily, while we conſider this, we muſt needs conclude, that Chriſts love was ſurpaſſing great, in that he would vouchſafe <hi>to ſeem</hi> (at leaſt) yea, and in a <hi>Human way,</hi> to be ſo little, and to lye ſo low for your ſakes. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4 Joyn to all theſe, <hi>the end of Chriſts coming into the World,</hi> and this will exceedingly heighten the demonſtration, and evince, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the love of Chriſt <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Why, for what did he come? upon what deſign came the <hi>King of glory</hi> from Heaven to Earth, in ſo mean a way? came he to take the <hi>Crowns</hi> off from the heads of <hi>Kings,</hi> and to put them upon his own? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Herod</hi> feared this, but without ground, for Chriſt came for no ſuch end. But the <hi>end</hi> for which he came was <hi>love.</hi> His deſign was to <hi>declare,</hi> &amp; make known that love which lay <hi>hid</hi> from eternity (in his own, and Fathers boſome) unto beleevers. Therefore it was that he was born in time, <hi>viz.</hi> that beleevers might
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100935:56"/>ſee, and know that love which hee bare to them from before time.</p>
            <p>I will in a word mention (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others) ſix particular ends for which Chriſt was born, and came into the world, and you will ſee them (like ſo many ſeveral <hi>lines</hi> in a Compaſs) meet all in <hi>love,</hi> as in their alone <hi>center.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt end for which he was born was, <hi>to redeem the precious ſouls of beleevers from that ſlavery in which they lay;</hi> yea and their <hi>bodies</hi> alſo from that <hi>vanity</hi> unto which (with the reſt of the Creatures) they were <hi>ſubjected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Chriſt ſaw his beloved, <hi>Captives</hi> in Sathans Kingdom, bound with <hi>chains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and made <hi>ſlaves</hi> unto his will; This ſight went to his Soul, and his love could not contain it ſelf, but he muſt come, that his beloved might bee ſet free. That this was the end of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent his Son</hi> (and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100935:56"/>he readily came) <hi>made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that wee might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> You were once ſlaves (beleevers) and Chriſt was born that you might be ſons; And a part of that adoption to which you were redeemed, is not only the redemption of your ſouls (though that bee the chief) but alſo, the <hi>redemption of your bodies,</hi> as it is clear, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.23. This was the end why Chriſt was born, and I think I need not ſay, it was an end of love, for you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, but you muſt confeſs that.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another end which Chriſt aimed at in his Nativity, was to be fitted to ſuffer for Beleevers ſakes. As Chriſt was God, and ſhined with the glory and Majeſty of the Deity, buffetings, ſpittings, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. could not, durſt not, take hold upon him; when he ſpake but that word, <hi>I AM HEE,</hi> the glory of his God-head ſhining
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100935:57"/>through it as through a creviſe) it is ſaid, they that came to ſeize him, <hi>went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> Joh. 18.6. Chriſt knew, that as hee was God, he could not ſuffer, and yet a neceſſity he ſaw of ſuffering for beleevers ſakes; therefore he was contented to cloud the glory of his Deity, with the mantle of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſo he might be fitted to ſuffer for them. When <hi>Codrus</hi> ſaw that his death would profit his Country, and that while he had on his Imperial robes none durſt ſlay him, the Hiſtorian ſaith, <hi>Depoſitis imperii inſignibus, famula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem cultum induit, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. <hi>He laid aſide the royal robe, and put on an homely habit,</hi> that he might be fit to dye in that diſguiſe. My beloved, the Lord Jeſus ſaw that the bloud of Bulls and Goats could not take away ſins; he ſaw alſo, that yet, if ever beleevers lived, it muſt be by bloud: And therefore, the Father having prepared him a body (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.) his heart had this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100935:57"/>law of love written in it, that he took the Body, that thereby he might bee fit to bleed. Surely you are blind if you ſee not love in this end, viz. That Chriſt was born to be fit to dye.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A third end why he was born, was, that hee might bee like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Love tends to likeneſſe, Chriſt, becauſe he loved, would bee born, that he might be like to them in all things, whom he loved above all things. <hi>He was made</hi> (ſaith the ſpirit) <hi>in the likeneſſe of man,</hi> Phil. 2.7. He beheld his beloved in the form of ſervants, and he would bee born, that he might be in their form. Chriſt ſaw his dear ones, cloathed with the ſackcloth of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (for that compared with the Angelical is but as hair to ſilk) and therefore ſtoopt to a Nativity, that he might be in the ſame faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and appear in the ſame ſuite. Though the Human Nature (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially cloathed with infirmities) were but a very mean array, yet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100935:58"/>his Divine love made him eſteem it above the Angelical; Therefore paſſing by <hi>the nature of Angels,</hi> he took upon <hi>him the nature of man,</hi> and was born, that he might be like unto beleevers. Surely this was love. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt in his Nativity aimed at another end (as like, in love, the former as might be) and that was, <hi>to unite himſelf more clearly and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly unto beleevers.</hi> Union is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of affection, and love deſires to unite. And if union be deſigned as the end of any act, we may ſafely ſay, Love was the Agent in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Chriſt indeed unites himſelf to Beleevers, by communicating unto them his own <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> but that hee might make the Union more firm, he was born to take upon him their <hi>Human nature.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, Chriſt is nearer united to you, than unto the Angels; his love to you did in this reſpect tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend his love to them; hee took not upon him their nature, and ſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100935:58"/>was not united to them that way; but he took upon him your nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was for this end born, that hee might be united to you this way. Say, is not this love? Yet</p>
            <p n="5">5 Chriſt had another end of love, for which hee was born, <hi>viz. That he might be fitted in a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner to condeſcend to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, yea, and to ſympathize with the infirmities, of beleevers.</hi> Chriſt deſires <hi>to converſe</hi> with them <hi>ſweetly,</hi> and <hi>to ſympathize</hi> with them ſeriouſly; neither of which he could ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do as God, therefore it was, he would be born <hi>man.</hi> As he was <hi>God,</hi> and had only the <hi>divine nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers were not able in ſo free a manner to converſe with him: his glory was ſo amazing, that their weak eyes could not behold it; his Majeſty was ſo overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, that then frail ſpirits could not converſe with it; Hee was therefore pleaſed to take our nature, and be born, that they might converſe familiarly with his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100935:59"/>grace and not <hi>dye,</hi> who could not <hi>behold</hi> fully his <hi>glory, and live.</hi> Had Jeſus Chriſt took upon him the nature of Angells, and ſo have come into the world unto his, alas, his preſence (like that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells) had been terrible! Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers could not have borne it. For this end therefore <hi>the word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us</hi> (as 'tis <hi>John</hi> 1.14.) That ſo we might <hi>behold the glory of God, in the only begotten ſon;</hi> the divine glory can now more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee contemplated by beleevers, while it is in the tent (that I may allude to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of fleſh; then it could bee by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now Beleevers may look upon the <hi>luſter of his Deity</hi> more ſweetly, while they can behold it as (it were) through the <hi>love-hood of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi> Beſides, Chriſt being born, he is now fitted to ſympathize with the infirmities of his. <hi>It behoved him</hi> (ſaith the Holy ghoſt) <hi>in all things to be made like</hi> (and this is ſpoken of his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100935:59"/>becomming man) <hi>unto his Brethren, that hee might bee</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>i. e.</hi> one that can ſhew tender mercy or pity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. Chriſt by his being born, and ſo actually experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the infirmities of the humane nature, knows now the better how to ſympathize with his. Now tell me, is not this great love, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt (who might (if he would) have ſolaced himſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his own glory, and never have ſtoopt to the ſence of our infirmities, yet that he) would be born, that ſo we might <hi>behold his glory, and he might ſympathize with us?</hi> he by his birth condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our capacities and making himſelfe ſenſible of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Adde to all theſe ends, this in the laſt place, <hi>That Chriſt by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity hath raiſed our humane nature, the dignity of which was another end of it.</hi> Oh! how might I ſhew the love of Chriſt to tranſcend in this end of his nativity! Certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100935:60"/>Chriſt by uniting your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his own, did mightily dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it. How doth the humane nature ſhine in the luſter of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? How doth the <hi>peble</hi> (mans nature) gliſter in the <hi>golden</hi> (I ſhould ſay the glorious) <hi>ring</hi> of the <hi>divine nature?</hi> O the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of Chriſt love, that hee would ſtoop ſo low, as to be born for this end, that thereby he might raiſe high the nature of his beloved ones, <hi>i.e.</hi> beleevers!</p>
            <p>So that thus you ſee how the birth of Chriſt (throughly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) giveth a bright diſcovery of the tranſcendency of his love. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if you ſpiritually contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate all that love which ſhines in the birth of the Lord Jeſus, you will eaſily conclude, that his love to beleevers <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond head (from which I ſaid I would demonſtrate the tranſcendency of Chriſts love) was the <hi>life of Chriſt.</hi> And now a little
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100935:60"/>to ſpeak to this: you muſt not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that I dare undertake the whole Hiſtory of his life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his tranſcendent love from every Act thereof; No, this were too large a field to walk in. I ſhall hint ſomething in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of it, and then I ſhall in a more particular manner ſpeak to ſome remarkable paſſages thereof, all ſpeaking tranſcendent love to beleevers. <hi>Generally, the life of Chriſt was a perfect myrrour of his love:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very action of it was full of love, and if wee put all the actions of his life together, we may conclude, that he was born, not ſo much to <hi>live,</hi> as to <hi>love.</hi> There was not a <hi>word</hi> which dropped from his lips, but it was full of love, and for his <hi>works</hi> which he did, they all ſpake love ſo loud, as that the deafeſt eare might hear it. So that we may ſay (as the Pſalmiſt in another caſe) <hi>There is no ſpeech, nor language, where the voyce of his love was not heard, the line thereof went through every act of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100935:61"/>his life.</hi> Should we begin at the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he diſputed with the Doctors, and follow him to the <hi>mount,</hi> where he was <hi>crucified by the ſouldiers,</hi> we ſhould ſee all the way ſtrewed with love-roſes. And as there is no beam in the Sunne, in which there is no light; ſo there was no Act in the life of Chriſt, but to a ſpirituall eie, ſhines with the light of love. But (omitting others) I ſhall inſtance only in five particulars, and ſhew how Chriſt in the actions of his life, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the tranſcendency of his love.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Jeſus Christ did run for beleevers ſakes through all the miſeries of this life.</hi> You cannot bee in any miſery <hi>(which is humane)</hi> but Chriſt was in it for you, <hi>to ſweeten it unto you.</hi> Art thou <hi>hungry?</hi> he was, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.3. Art thou <hi>thirſty?</hi> hee was: Art thou <hi>weary?</hi> hee was, <hi>John</hi> 4.6. Meeteſt thou with <hi>ſcoffings, ſcornings, deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, blaſphemies, buffettings,</hi> Why thy Lord Chriſt out of his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100935:61"/>love) runned through all theſe in his life for thee. Beleevers, I beſeech you mind it, when ever you meet with any of the miſeries of this life, your beloved met with them for your ſakes, and that for this end, that hee might ſweeten them to your ſouls. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you meet with, and are preſſed by the miſeries of this life in any kind, then think upon your Saviours love, who lived a life ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of theſe miſeries, out of his love to you. And I doubt not but you will ſay, <hi>O tranſcendent love!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſubmitted to all the duties of religion (which was not only to fulfill the righteouſneſs of the law) but to declare the infinitnes of his love:</hi> for by it <hi>beleevers may ſee, he requires of them at no time, more than he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> The <hi>yoak</hi> of Chriſt, by this is made <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>eaſie.</hi> Now his commandements will appear, not to be <hi>grievous,</hi> becauſe hee did obey them firſt himſelf. There is no duty (O beleeving ſoul) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:100935:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>which thou canſt be called in the whole courſe of thy life, but thy Saviour in his life did the ſame. The child may well ſay, he hath a loving father, when as he can ſee him firſt doing that himſelf in his own perſon, which hee commands it to do. Your <hi>everlaſting Father</hi> Jeſus Chriſt (O ye <hi>children of faith</hi>) in his life went through (in his own perſon) all thoſe performances which you are to do in Religion. And is not this tranſcendent love?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Our Lord, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the whole courſe of his life, was ever carefull to provide and uſe all poſſible means for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of beleevers graces.</hi> Knowledge &amp; Faith, are the two great graces for the ſweetning of the life of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Chriſt was very carefull to ſtrengthen them. Therefore it was that hee ſpake chiefly to thoſe things which might ſtrengthen theſe <hi>graces.</hi> For <hi>knowledge,</hi> how lovingly did hee ſpeak that which his Diſciples <hi>were able to bear?</hi> And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100935:62"/>if he thought they did not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he ſaid, how loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did he <hi>expound all things to them when they were alone?</hi> as tis, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 33, 34. Yea when they asked him of any Parable, what its meaning might be, How lovingly did hee ſatisfie their deſires, telling them, that it was their privilege, and to <hi>them it was given to know the myſterys of the kingdome of God?</hi> Luke 8.9, 10. nay, when Jeſus had ſpoke any thing which they underſtood not, and did but <hi>perceive their reaſoning among themſelves</hi> about it, he did voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (not being asked) inform them, as in that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9. And for <hi>faith,</hi> its eaſie to obſerve how ready Chriſt was to ſtrengthen it. Did he not rejoyce when he had an opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſo to do? Mark that in <hi>Job.</hi> 11. when <hi>Lazarus was dead,</hi> and hee knew how his raiſing of him would conduce to the confirming of their <hi>faith,</hi> hee profeſſeth (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) that <hi>he was glad for their ſakes,</hi> that hee was not there when
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100935:63"/>he dyed, <hi>to the intent they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> verſ. 15. Now (my beloved,) what doth this care of Chriſt to ſtrengthen your graces declare, but the tranſcendency of his love to your ſouls?</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Jeſus Chriſt in his life aimed more at, and rejoyced more in Beleevers comforts than his own.</hi> When he heard that great voyce from heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I have glorified it</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> his name) and <hi>I will glorifie it;</hi> He ſaid, <hi>This voice came not for his ſake, but for his Diſciples.</hi> It ſeems his end in that requeſt (for that voyce was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his prayer) was not his glory, but their good. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not rejoycing himſelf in the <hi>excellent glory</hi> of that voice from heaven, hee ſpeaks to them, and applies it to them, profeſſing it was for <hi>their ſakes,</hi> Joh. 12.30. Hence it is alſo, that hee, when hee was to die, and <hi>knew that his houre was come</hi> (and ſo one would think ſhould have retired, and ſpent his time for himſelf) hee ſet himſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100935:63"/>his Diſciples, that in ſo doing, he might declare that having loved them, he loved them to the end with a tranſcendent love, Joh. 13.1. Tell me (my beloved) ſhould you ſee one going to the Stake, or Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to dye, and ſhould you obſerve him ſpend all his time, breath, and eloquence, in comforting ſome one dear beloved; would not you ſay his love did tranſcend, in making him forget himſelf, to comfort her? why ſo it was with your Saviour, There were but few houres ere he was to be taken, and to ſuffer. And yet, as if he minded (as indeed he did) the comfort of his Diſciples more than his own, he improves all that time, and ſpent (as it were) all his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon them, labouring to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence their diſpairings, and ſorrows, not minding his owne death, and ſufferings. Oh tranſcendent love!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it muſt be alſo minded, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt being to pray to his Father</hi> (the laſt action as it were of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100935:64"/>his life) <hi>he in that prayer declared the tranſcendency of his love, by putting up more requeſts in the behalf of beleevers, than of himſelf.</hi> You know the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. And if you obſerve it, you ſhall finde, that albeit in the beginning he prayes for himſelf, in that <hi>(Father the houre is come, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy Son)</hi> yet having but (as it were) mentioned this in the 1 <hi>verſ.</hi> and reiterated it in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. he doth (in a manner) ſhut himſelf out of all the reſt of the prayer, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it wholly for beleevers. And oh what glorious things did he beg in their behalf! <hi>That the Father would keep and preſerve them,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>That he would own and ſanctifie them,</hi> ver. 10, 17. <hi>That they might be one with the Father, as he was one,</hi> ver. 21, 22. And in the cloſe of all, how doth he intreat the Father, to <hi>admit them to be ther where he was, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory?</hi> and how ſtrongly doth he argue for this? doth he not uſe the cogent motive of love? <hi>for thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me,</hi> ver. 24. As if he ſhould ſay,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100935:64"/>
               <hi>Father, I know thou loveſt me, thou didſt ſo before ever the world was; now I beſeech thee, by that love, as if ever thou wouldeſt declare that thou doſt love me, own, preſerve, ſanctifie, make one with thyſelf, mine, as I am</hi> (for this is the argument to the whole prayer) and <hi>let them, whom I loved in the world, bee with me when they leave the world: O Father, as thou loveſt me, hear, grant this</hi> (as my laſt) <hi>requeſt for my beloved ones.</hi> Tell me now, how tranſcendent is Chriſts love? and how near do beleevers lye to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? who being now (as it were) to pray and dye, forgets himſelf, and breaths out his laſt requeſts in ſo many, ſo tranſcendent particulars in their behalfs.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how eaſie it is to runne through the life of Chriſt, and yet running, to read all along tranſcendent love to beleevers. But I muſt now ſpeak a word to the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> and you ſhall ſee this alſo as <hi>lively</hi> demonſtrating (as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or both the other branches)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100935:65"/>the truth of the point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>love of Chriſt to beleevers paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third head of demonſtrations being the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to it a little diſtinctly, though briefly.</p>
            <p>But where ſhall we begin his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton? and at what part of it ſhall we enter upon this demonſtration? ſhall we goe with him into the <hi>Garden</hi> (indeed there it began) or ſhall wee aſcend <hi>Mount Calvary</hi> (how upon it, it ended) or ſhall we ſpeak of what he ſuffered in the <hi>high Prieſts hall?</hi> I think it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to mention each.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore at the <hi>Garden</hi> in which Chriſt was taken. O how tranſcendently ſweet is the <hi>ſmell</hi> of his love here!</p>
            <p>Beleevers look upon your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Garden; See him, when his ſoul <hi>began to be ſorrowfull and very heavy,</hi> and liſten a little to what he ſaith, <hi>My ſoule is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, even unto the death,</hi> Matth. 26.38.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100935:65"/>you experienced Saints! Tell mee, what manner of love is this: For your Lord to be ſad unto the death, that he might remove thoſe clouds, which have ſometimes kept your ſoules in the <hi>ſhadows of death and darkneſſe?</hi> But go on and liſten to your Lords cry to the father, once, &amp; again, when he begged that the <hi>cup might paſſe from him:</hi> Surely the <hi>wrath in the bottom of the cup</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter (which made him deſire to be delivered from it:) But as ſurely the <hi>love in Chriſts beſome</hi> was very <hi>ſweet,</hi> which yet prevaileth with him, to ſubmit his <hi>will</hi> to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to <hi>drink it up</hi> for your ſake. Did you hear ever of <hi>ſweating</hi> in a <hi>cold night,</hi> and that upon the <hi>cold ground,</hi> in an <hi>open Garden?</hi> Surely you will ſay hee muſt be <hi>hot within,</hi> that can, or could do ſo. Why the <hi>heat</hi> of your Saviours <hi>love</hi> was ſuch, as that it ſupported him to bear the <hi>heat</hi> of Gods <hi>wrath,</hi> than as <hi>cold</hi> as the <hi>night</hi> was (and twas a winters night as is rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100935:66"/>and as open as the place was <hi>(a garden)</hi> yet then, and there, he did ſweat, and that clods of blood (his veines iſſuing out freely, and the air congeling it preſently) and this, in the beginning of his ſufferings, beleevers, for your ſakes. I preſume you are not blind (and yet certainly you are) if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read matchleſſe love in this. Some have been ſo weak (reports reiterated tell us ſo) as to write letters to their beloved with their blood: If it be true, you will ſay it is much (and Ile ſay, 'twas mad) But yet let me tell you, its no ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tale, but a ſweet truth, <hi>Chriſt in the garden bled enough to write a large letter of love to you</hi> And if you read ſpiritually, you read ſuch love, as yet, when you read, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expres it, while you read the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts agony in the garden. The greatneſſe of <hi>Adams folly</hi> is not ſo legible in his <hi>eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden frult in the garden</hi> (which was the ſhutting or us out
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100935:66"/>of paradiſe) As the <hi>tranſcendency of Chriſts love, is in his agony in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> (which was to re-inſtate belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in a happyer ſtate than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe was, or could bee.)</p>
            <p>But lets follow our Lord, from the <hi>garden</hi> to the <hi>High Prieſts hall,</hi> and here, let's hear a little the <hi>hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out-cryes of the rude rabble againſt him.</hi> Ah Lord! what was that ſtopped our Saviours ears, ſo that hee would not regard? and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his tongue, that hee would not reply? was't not love? when you read, how ſome <hi>ſpit upon,</hi> and others <hi>railed</hi> at Chriſt; How <hi>ſome blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him,</hi> and others <hi>buffetted him;</hi> how many <hi>ſcoffed,</hi> how many <hi>ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> how many <hi>accuſed,</hi> how all <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt him?</hi> I ſay, when you read this, cannot you as ſweetly read the <hi>tranſcendent love</hi> of Chriſt to you, as the <hi>tranſcendent malice</hi> of the Jews againſt Chriſt?</p>
            <p>But not to ſtay here, goe out with Chriſt to <hi>Calvary.</hi> (As hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends the Mount, doth not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100935:67"/>aſcend too?) See him <hi>nailed to the Croſſe, for your ſakes,</hi> and tell mee, if that ſight doth not clear this truth (<hi>as a nail faſtened by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of aſſomblies,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> was) <hi>viz.</hi> That the love of Chriſt <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi> Surely, beleevers, <hi>Chriſts hanging on the Croſſe,</hi> and then <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his laſt breath,</hi> and <hi>powre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hearts blood,</hi> in a <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, curſed,</hi> and <hi>tormenting way,</hi> for your ſakes, is enough to make you <hi>[cry]</hi> out, <hi>O the depth of his love!</hi> 'Twas well ſaid by one, <hi>that Mount Calvary, was Loves Academy:</hi> and he is worſe than a <hi>Dunce,</hi> that cannot learn the tranſcendency of Chriſts love to beleevers here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The blood of the Croſſe ſpeaks love in ſtrength, and no ſuch Sermon of love in the Bible, nor in the Creation, as the blood of the Croſſe,</hi> ſaith a fine pen. Greater love than this hath no <hi>[man] that a man lay down his life for his friends, Joh.</hi> 15.13. Indeed, <hi>man</hi> hath no greater (nay ſcarce ſo great a love as that:) But Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100935:67"/>had, and ſhewed as great, (nay a far greater love than this) for hee laid down his life for his <hi>foes</hi> (ſuch, beleevers, you were.) 'Twas but a <hi>brag of Peter</hi> (his words were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his love) when hee ſaid, hee would <hi>dye for Christ:</hi> But 'twas a <hi>reality</hi> in Chriſt, when ſpeaking of the baptiſm of his death, hee ſaid, <hi>How am I ſtreightened till it bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly it was <hi>large love,</hi> that <hi>ſtreightened</hi> his ſoul, till he taſted of death for you. The Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it, as the character of the tranſcendency of the Martyrs love to Chriſt, that they loved <hi>not their lives unto the death</hi> for his ſake: But alas, their death for Chriſt was but their duty (they were bound to it, becauſe Chriſt loved them;) Whereas Chriſts love to us is <hi>grace,</hi> for <hi>hee loved us firſt.</hi> Ask a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactour, what if the Prince's Son ſhould go to his father and ſay, <hi>Father, I confeſſe the wretch is deſervedly to dye, but I ſee a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100935:68"/>in thee, that hee ſhould live; only I perceive it ſticks with thy Juſtice: Thou wouldeſt magnifie thy mercy in his pardon, couldeſt thou alſo ſatisfie thy juſtice: why? for that Father here I am, and I will dye my ſelf to ſatisfie thy juſtice, onely let the poor wretch live, to the glory of thine, and my free grace;</hi> and having thus ſaid, ſhould goe to the place of execution, and <hi>dye indeed:</hi> Ask (I ſay) the Malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, what kind of love hee counts, and calls this? Beleevers, ask your own hearts (for you were the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors) and tell mee, what word is great enough to expreſſe the great love of Jeſus Chriſt, which hee live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed to you, in his death for you? Surely you will ſay, the <hi>thought</hi> of the love is too <hi>big</hi> for your mouth, you cannot through your <hi>narrow expreſſions,</hi> let out your large conceptions, of Chriſts love in his death.</p>
            <p>I muſt profeſſe, if you can, I cannot: This head of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is fitter for <hi>meditation,</hi> than

The thoughts of Chriſts life are ſwallowed up by the thoughts of his <hi>death;</hi> His death doth ſet out his love moſt to the <hi>life.</hi> I will wind up this head with this concluſion; You are no Scholars <hi>in Chriſts School,</hi> if you cannot read a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>long lecture</hi> of love upon Chriſts <hi>Croſſe.</hi> Let it paſſe as an <hi>aphoriſm, The love of Chriſt, expreſſed in his death, tranſcends ſo high above our thoughts, that wee ſhall never bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to the height thereof, all our life.</hi> His love <hi>tranſcends our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, confounds our conceptions:</hi> yet it muſt be believed and applyed.</p>
            <p>At preſent, I ſhall offer but three words, to help you in the application of the tranſcendency of Chriſts love to beleevers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>ſtand and wonder</hi> (O belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoules) <hi>at this love;</hi> Indeed it's fitter for <hi>wonder</hi> than <hi>words:</hi> Think upon this that I have ſaid, and let
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100935:69"/>your thoughts dwell upon the meditations hereof; and when in <hi>the working of your thoughts,</hi> you haveaſcended to ſome <hi>height,</hi> then, in the <hi>wonderment of your ſoules,</hi> cry out, O the <hi>depth</hi> of the love of Chriſt, which <hi>paſſeth knowledge!</hi> Wonder and ſay, <hi>Lord Jeſus, what is man (by ſin the worſt of creatures) and what am I (by unbelief the worſt of men) that thou ſhouldeſt thus minde me, as to bee born for me, to live, yea to [dye] to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare love to me!</hi> O that you would <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>loſe your ſelves</hi> in the thoughts of your Saviours love! And when you have <hi>loſt</hi> your ſelves <hi>(which you may interpret found your ſoules)</hi> in the bottomleſſe gulf of your Lords love; then recover your ſpirits again, and cry out, <hi>Oh the dazling heights! Oh the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (yet comfortable) <hi>depths! Oh the divine</hi> (yet immenſurable) <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> of the love of Chriſt, <hi>which paſſeth knowledge!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Lament! O lament</hi> (beleevers) <hi>when you conſider, that notwithſtanding
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100935:69"/>Chriſt doth thus love you, yet you are too too apt to neglect the conſideration thereof, and too too poor in it's requitall.</hi> That holy man (Mr. <hi>Welch</hi>) wept, <hi>becauſe he ſaw his heart ſo dull, that hee could not conſider the love of Chriſt as he ſhould, and would.</hi> And truly, who can with a dry eye conſider, the neglect of the thought of the tranſcendent love of Chriſt? what O ſoul, doth Chriſt love thee much, and doſt thou think on it but little? Canſt thou ſpend daies and weeks in reading the <hi>fond fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of feigned loves?</hi> And haſt not thou an houre to meditate on the <hi>real royall love of the Lord Jeſus?</hi> And as thou <hi>mindeſt</hi> it but <hi>ſeldome,</hi> ſo thou <hi>requiteſt</hi> it but <hi>ſorrily.</hi> What <hi>ſmall returns</hi> of love, hath Chriſt had from thee, for this <hi>vast expence</hi> of love upon thee? He loves us <hi>richly;</hi> but, alas, we love him <hi>poorly.</hi> His love <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> none can underſtand it; and our love in a ſad ſenſe, <hi>paſſeth knowledge</hi> too, for none can perceive it. How little,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100935:70"/>alas, do wee, will wee forſake for Chriſt? (And yet hee forſook much for us.)</p>
            <p>Hee forſook <hi>Heaven,</hi> and came into the world for us; and wee will not forſake <hi>earth</hi> (although it be to goe to <hi>Heaven</hi>) for him; hee did <hi>much</hi> for us (and counted it but little) hee liv'd from firſt to laſt for us; but wee doe but <hi>little</hi> for him, and yet wee count it much, grudging to give him the laſt and leaſt, though Satan hath had the firſt, and moſt part of our life. Hee, as you have heard, <hi>ſuffered</hi> for us even <hi>death</hi> it ſelf; but which of us is willing to <hi>taſte of ſuffering</hi> for him? True, <hi>ſome</hi> have ſaid, <hi>If they had a thouſand heads, they would loſe them all for Chriſt;</hi> yet theſe <hi>ſome</hi> are but <hi>few:</hi> For who of us would loſe <hi>one head</hi> for him? <hi>Ignatius</hi> (in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times) ſaid, hee was willing to endure <hi>fire, croſſe, butcheries,</hi> and all for Chriſt; but theſe are the latter dayes, and though his love was <hi>hot,</hi> ours is grown <hi>cold;</hi> wee can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100935:70"/>ſcarce endure a word, a <hi>jeer,</hi> a <hi>ſcoff</hi> for Chriſt. Well, I beſeech you <hi>ſit,</hi> and <hi>ſigh,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Oh! how meanly do we requite the love of Chriſt! He was born, lived, died out of love to us: But we are ſo far from dying for Chriſt, that we ſcarce are willing to live to Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in as much as Chriſt thus loves you (O beleevers) with a tranſcendent love, <hi>Be you ſatisfied herewith,</hi> and be <hi>content</hi> (if it muſt be ſo) <hi>to want the love of men.</hi> Its a ſhame that any who are the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Chriſt, ſhould mourn for not being loved of the creature. Why ſhould the <hi>Kings daughter, who hath</hi> (or at leaſt ſhould) <hi>forget her kindred, and her fathers houſe,</hi> Why (I ſay) ſhould ſhe (<hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>beleeving ſoul</hi>) weep, becauſe the <hi>ſcullion</hi> ſcorns her, when the King himſelf em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth her? Its but meet that you ſhould reſt ſatisfied in the love of Chriſt, ſith its ſo tranſcendent. Wherefore, <hi>drink waters out of thine own ciſtern!</hi> (O Chriſtian) and (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>rejoyce with the wife</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:100935:71"/>(or rather with Chriſt the <hi>husband</hi>) <hi>of thy youth: let him be as the loving Hinde and pleaſant Roe; let his breaſts ſatisfy thee at all times.</hi> Do not <hi>erre,</hi> in <hi>mourning</hi> for the want, or <hi>hunting</hi> after the enjoyment of creature-love; but <hi>erre alwaies,</hi> or (as wee render it) <hi>be raviſhed alwaies with his love.</hi> Bathe thy ſelf (Oh beleever) alwaies in Chriſts boſome; live upon, and be contented with his love: Let others <hi>ſip,</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> (if they'l be ſo weak) of the <hi>puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>creatures love;</hi> while thou, as wiſe, neither <hi>envieſt,</hi> nor <hi>deſireſt to partake with them.</hi> Surely did you but remember this, that <hi>the love of Chriſt</hi> (towards you) <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> you would not be diſcontented at the want of the love of any, or all the creatures; conſidering therefore that it is ſuch, be you contented with it. Its a ſign that the love of Chriſt <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thy knowledg,</hi> in the tranſcendent worth thereof, If in the midſt of the abſence of all other loves, thou canſt be content and ſatisfied with this.</p>

            <p>Firſt, If we do conſider the <hi>command which Chriſt exerciſeth</hi> over <hi>beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100935:72"/>we ſhall ſee the tranſcendency of his affection even in that. It is Chriſts <hi>glory,</hi> that he is the <hi>King of the Saints</hi> (in a peculiar manner) and it is his <hi>grace,</hi> that he exerciſeth that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power in a ſweet way. How ever <hi>he ruleth the Nation with a rod of iron,</hi> yet he ruleth the Saints with a <hi>golden Scepter.</hi> Hence it is, that although in wrath, his iron rod <hi>break the Nations in peeces,</hi> yet his golden Scepter is ſtill ſtretched out in love, to entertain the Saints. You read in <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. that <hi>Solomon made a Chariot of the wood of Lebanon, he made the pillars thereof of ſilver, the bottome of gold, the covering of it of purple, the middeſt being [PAVED WITH LOVE] Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. That Chariot which <hi>Solomon</hi> made for himſelf, and in which hee rode, might well ſet out the Chariot in which Chriſt rideth up and down the <hi>world of beleevers,</hi> whom he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns. Indeed it is very glorious, and it glitters with beams of light, but withall it is very gracious, as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100935:73"/>being <hi>paved with ſtones of love;</hi> Love is the <hi>throne</hi> in which he ſits, love is the <hi>Scepter</hi> with which hee ruleth, and all his government is managed in ſuch a way, as that beleevers may ſay, that he is the Lord of love even in his ruling of them. <hi>Abſolom</hi> did but flatter, when hee ſtood by the way of the gate, and <hi>kiſſed all that paſſed by</hi> (and by it inſinuated how ſweetly hee would govern, if he came to the Kingdome) but that which was <hi>flattery</hi> in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> is <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in Chriſt, When any of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall pilgrims come (as beleevers do) to do him obeyſance (as they ought to doe, being under his commands) hee putteth forth his hands, and taketh them, and kiſſeth them, and doth not only promiſe, but perform tranſcendent love in all his commands over them. But to read this more particularly, you will ſee the tranſcendency of Chriſts love diſcovered in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over beleevers, if you conſider three things.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:100935:73"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt layeth no commands upon beleevers, but ſuch as are full of love &amp; ſweetneſſe.</hi> He reduceth all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue to theſe two heads, <hi>Thu ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart; and with all thy ſoul, and with al thy mind: and thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf,</hi> Mat. 22.37.39. Well might <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>That his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3.

Indeed he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>(which is his peculiar Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative)</hi> what he <hi>pleaſed,</hi> but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nothing but what is <hi>pleaſant</hi> in it ſelf, and will be ſo to a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoul (which is the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his love) <hi>A new Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another,</hi> Joh. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 34. Well may the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be called <hi>New,</hi> it being ſuch as was never given by any King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf: And ſurely there
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100935:74"/>was great love in his <hi>boſome</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, when hee only laid a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or a command of Love upon their <hi>ſhoulders. All her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. The waies of Chriſt (which are his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) are waies of pleaſantneſſe (for I take it,<note place="margin">The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is uſed for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of a life of love. 2 Sam. 1 26.</note> that <hi>Solomon</hi> there by wiſdome underſtandeth Chriſt.) Beleevers, if you could but <hi>live in love,</hi> you would <hi>fulfill the Law</hi> of your Lord; for hee being a Lord of love to you, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law</hi> he layeth upon you. Yea ſuch is the tranſcendency of his love to beleevers, that <hi>hee layeth no Commandement upon them, to do any thing, which hee did not himſelf.</hi> Fleſh and Blood may think it a hard, and a harſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to waſh the feet of a poor beleever, a fellow ſervant: But grace will ſee the Command to be ſweet, and lovely? (and Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>loving</hi> in laying this Command) becauſe it is no other than what himſelf hath done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100935:74"/>Ask the ſervant whether his Lord be loving, who layeth no Commandement upon him, but that which is ſweet in its ſelf, and ſweet in its fruit, and no worſe than his Lord himſelf will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Beleevers, it is your caſe, all the Commands of your Lord Chriſt are ſweet in themſelves, and ſweet in their fruit; and they are ſuch as he himſelf (while hee lived) ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped unto. Doth not this declare tranſcendent love?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt layeth all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in a way of love;</hi> that which he biddeth beleevers do (who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command) it is in a loving way: As the command is, ſo is the manner of its impoſing, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſweet and loving. It is poſſible, that a ſweet thing may be injoyned in a harſh way: An eaſie commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it ſelf may be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the way of its impoſall. To command with a <hi>bended fiſt,</hi> and a <hi>frowning forehead,</hi> is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a loving way: but now Jeſus
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100935:75"/>Chriſt, when ever he commandeth, hee commandeth ſweetly, and ſmilingly: <hi>he doth not lift up his voyce, and cry</hi> (as ſome underſtand that place) <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Hee doth not <hi>ſpeak in an auſtere, rough, rugged manner:</hi> But as the Lord is, ſo is his <hi>language, loving.</hi> Obſerve with what love he layeth his commands on beleevers; <hi>You are my friends, if you do whatſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15 14. He doth not threaten, and ſay, I will be your <hi>Foe,</hi> if you will not obey; but if you do, you ſhall bee my <hi>Friends.</hi> And ſo again, <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandements.</hi> It is worth the noting, that <hi>grace</hi> may be ſaid to come in this reſpect by Chriſt: He gave not his <hi>Law</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) with <hi>thundring and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> in a dreadfull manner; But he gave the Law to his Diſciples him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a ſweet and loving way. Hee beginneth his Sermons, with <hi>Bleſſed are ye:</hi> And all his commands drop from him like the <hi>drops of dew upon the tender graſſe;</hi> He ſhall come down
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100935:75"/>(ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. <hi>v.</hi> 6.) <hi>like rain upon the mown graſſe, as ſhowers that water the earth, i. e.</hi> Hee ſhall come down, both ſoftly and ſweetly; this is ſpoke of Chriſts comming as a King; ſo that you may ſee the tranſcendency of Chriſts love unto you, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which hee layeth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements on you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider the end that Chriſt doth aim at in all his Commandements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that will alſo diſcover the tranſcendency of his love to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Hee ſeeks not himſelf, but them, in all his Commands. Hee biddeth the beleever <hi>work,</hi> not that he may <hi>reap</hi> any thing himſelf, but that the beleever may <hi>get all;</hi> hee putteth them to <hi>labour in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> that they may have all the <hi>harveſt.</hi> As it is inconſiſtent with his <hi>Deity,</hi> to have any thing added to him, ſo alſo it is inconſiſtent with his <hi>love;</hi> Hee putteth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to <hi>reap,</hi> that they may have all the <hi>corn,</hi> and hee ſetteth them to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100935:76"/>
               <hi>work,</hi> rather that he may <hi>give them wages,</hi> than that himſelf ſhall <hi>get</hi> any thing by their workings. <hi>Take my yoke upon you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and you ſhall finde reſt unto your ſoules.</hi> Chriſt layeth a yoke upon their necks, not to <hi>burthen</hi> them, but to <hi>eaſe</hi> them; not to <hi>break</hi> their <hi>backs,</hi> but to <hi>refreſh</hi> their <hi>boſomes.</hi> Many Kings, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, aim at themſelves in their commands, and they ſeek too too often, rather their own greatneſſe, than their Subjects good. But (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it) Jeſus Chriſt <hi>your King,</hi> is not ſuch an one; All that he aims at in his government is your good: The end of his Commandements are your comfort; As his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment increaſeth over you, ſo his <hi>peace</hi> increaſeth in you: This is the effect, and fruit of all his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, not ſo much that others may take notice of his <hi>glory in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,</hi> as that you may find his <hi>grace in obeying.</hi> Indeed, love is the work and wages of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; hee therefore bids you do
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100935:76"/>ſo, that he may love you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that though you are frail, and weak, and cannot obey, hee will be kind to love you, notwithſtanding all.</p>
            <p>So that now the Commands of Chriſt, being as it were love <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> (in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi>) and love <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> (in their <hi>impoſals</hi>) and love <hi>finally</hi> (in their <hi>aim</hi>) what can you conclude from all this, but that the love of Chriſt, even to beleevers, is declared to be tranſcendent in the exerciſe of his command over them?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſts care ſpeaks love.</note>Secondly, conſider <hi>the care that Chriſt hath of them.</hi> O the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love that Chriſt expreſſeth to beleevers, in the care that hee taketh of them for all neceſſities! He is not only a <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>command,</hi> and to ſet them on work; but he is a <hi>Father to take care,</hi> and provide for his. And it is eaſie to obſerve tranſcendency of love, in the tranſcendent care that Chriſt hath to provide for his. <hi>Food,</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> and <hi>lodging,</hi> are the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100935:77"/>leaſt things that can be taken care for; and yet you ſhall ſee Chriſt doth not only take care for them, but he doth take care for other things alſo; yea, and as he doth take care that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have <hi>food</hi> to eat, ſo it is of the fineſt (<hi>the kidnys of the wheat,</hi> and the fineſt flower;) Rayment, and glorious rayment, a <hi>houſe,</hi> &amp; a brave one too. Firſt, <hi>Chriſt taketh care that beleevers may have food to eat.</hi> Hee knoweth they muſt have bread, and therefore hee hath provided <hi>bread of life;</hi> hee knoweth they muſt have drink, and therefore hee hath <hi>opened the ſealed fountain of the water of life.</hi> The care that God hath to feed his people in the Wilderneſſe, did demonſtrate his love unto them, that he gave them <hi>quails</hi> and <hi>mannah, &amp;c.</hi> Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, while you are in the <hi>wilderneſſe of this world,</hi> your Lord hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his love, in making rich provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>ſpiritual food</hi> for you: Hee hath prepared the <hi>hidden mannah</hi> which hee will give unto you; <hi>A feaſt of fat things, full of marrow, of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100935:77"/>wine on the Lees, well refined,</hi> as it is <hi>Eſay.</hi> 25.6. Nay, even in the <hi>middeſt of your enemies he hath prepared a table for you:</hi> And not only that you may be ſure of <hi>food,</hi> but that the <hi>food</hi> might be ſurpaſſingly <hi>ſweet,</hi> Hee hath made <hi>himſelf to be meat for you.</hi> If it be true, that the <hi>Pelican feedeth her young ones with her own blood;</hi> then that <hi>Bird</hi> may be a <hi>type</hi> of your <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:</hi> His fleſh is <hi>meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed;</hi> and this doth hee give for the life of your ſouls (O beleevers.) <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that ſhee might outvie <hi>Marke Antonies</hi> love, cauſed (as the Hiſtory relateth) a <hi>pearl</hi> of great price to be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> that he might <hi>drink</hi> thereof: Chriſt, beleevers, hath done more for you, and hath <hi>outvied her</hi> love to him; <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>ſilver,</hi> &amp; <hi>pearls,</hi> are but <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things,</hi> in compariſon of this precious blood, and yet that blood he hath prepared for beleevers to drink, that they might live for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt hath provided not only food for the belly, but rayment for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100935:78"/>the back too.</hi> And as the <hi>food,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>rayment</hi> do tranſcend in love. <hi>A garment of needle-work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.14.</note> 
               <hi>rich, and coſtly attire,</hi> Chriſt hath provided for beleevers: When thou waſt <hi>naked,</hi> (beleever) and hadſt no cloaths to cover thee, but the <hi>filthy rags of thine own works</hi> (which did defile thee) <hi>then,</hi> even <hi>then he cloathed thee in broidered work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.10, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhod thee with badgers skins, and covered thee with fine linnen, and decked thee with ornaments, and put bracelets on thine hands, and a chain on thy neck, &amp; a jewel on thy ſorehead, &amp; ear-rings on thine ears, &amp; a beautifull Crown upon thine head; &amp;c.</hi> Thus did he adorn thee, and thus did he array thee, and <hi>thou waſt exceeding glorious with the garments he put on thee.</hi> Greater love can none declare than this, to give another as good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as himſelf doth wear; why, this doth Jeſus Chriſt. In the mount of Tranſfiguration, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 2.) it is ſaid, <hi>his rayment was as white as the light:</hi> And when the Saints appeared to <hi>John</hi> in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100935:78"/>they appeared in garments of the ſame colour; it is ſaid, They were <hi>arrayed with white robes,</hi> Rev. 7 13. Righteouſneſſe is his garment, and ſo it is beleevers too. It was an act of great love to <hi>Mordecay</hi> (and <hi>Haman</hi> thought the King could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe no greater) that the <hi>Royal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel ſhould be brought which the King uſed to wear,</hi> and to be put on him. Why, beleevers, ſuch is the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love of Chriſt to his, in <hi>his</hi> care for your apparrel, that the <hi>roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al apparrel which he weareth himſelf</hi> is brought to you, and is put on your ſouls <hi>Now</hi> (and you are <hi>all glorious within</hi> here,) and it ſhall be put on your bodies <hi>hereafter;</hi> even that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is now <hi>vile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. laſt.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be made glorious, like to his glorious body:</hi> And when Chriſt ſhall come, and appear in his garments of glory,<note place="margin">Col 3.4. 1 Joh. 3.3.</note> you <hi>ſhall appear with him in the like:</hi> And then he ſhall be <hi>admired,</hi> not only in himſelf,<note place="margin">2 Theſ 1.10.</note> but <hi>in you.</hi> O tranſcendent love, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould provide ſuch cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100935:79"/>for us poor creatures!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>as for lodging,</hi> Chriſt hath provided that likewiſe for beleevers. Indeed himſelf had no houſe here on earth (not ſo much as a hole wherein to lay his head) and therfore belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers fare no worſer <hi>here</hi> than he did, they have as good a lodging as their Lord: In <hi>this world</hi> indeed they have not a houſe to be in, nor a bed to lye on (as their own;) But as to <hi>hereafter</hi> he hath provided a <hi>houſ,</hi> and that not a <hi>mean</hi> one, but a <hi>manſion houſe,</hi> and the building thereof is brave; It is a <hi>building of God,</hi> and the bravery of it appeareth in this (which was the bravery of Chriſts body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.) that it is a <hi>houſe not made with hands.</hi> The <hi>Shunamite</hi> did declare her love to the <hi>man of God,</hi> by making of him <hi>a litle chamber,</hi> and by ſetting a <hi>bed</hi> therein, and <hi>a table,</hi> and <hi>a ſtoole,</hi> and <hi>a candleſtick</hi> for him, 2 King. 4.10. Jeſus Chriſt ſheweth greater love than this, in having provided a better room for beleevers; not a <hi>little Chamber,</hi> but a <hi>great Manſion</hi> (a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100935:79"/>bed of glory, <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome) not a <hi>ſtool,</hi> but a <hi>Throne,</hi> not a <hi>candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke</hi> (no nor the Sunne) but <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> to be as <hi>a light,</hi> this not <hi>on the wall</hi> (as it were without his own Palace) but even <hi>within,</hi> where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is, in his own preſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> Conſider this, beleevers, Chriſt hath prepared as good a houſe for you, as for himſelf, and when he was, as it were, in the entry thereof, he ſtood at the door, and did in a manner agree with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> before hand, that you ſhould come in as well as himſelf: and therefore it was, (he ſaid) he went to <hi>propare a place for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now here is rich provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of neceſſaries, <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>lodging:</hi> And what doth this declare, but rich love in Chriſt, that he ſhould take ſuch care of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers?</p>
            <p>Wee might adde, not onely that Chriſt hath prepared theſe things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100935:80"/>which are the <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> but hee hath prepared other things which are <hi>glorious.</hi> But oh, who ſhall bee able to declare all the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which Chriſt hath made for his! When as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive thoſe things;</hi> we will therefore break out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe, which thou haſt laid up as a ſecret treaſure</hi> (for ſo the word ſignifieth) <hi>for them that love thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. Thus you ſee the tranſcendent love of Chriſt in his <hi>care for,</hi> as well as his <hi>command over</hi> beleevers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, we might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly demonſtrate the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love to beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Chriſts endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers of his love, ſpeaks its greatneſſe.</note> 
               <hi>in his indeavour to declare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the hearts of beleevers of all this love.</hi> That Chriſt ſhould love at all, and love ſo much is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; But that he ſhould take paines to perſwade the hearts of beleevers to beleeve this, is an <hi>addition to the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100935:80"/>tranſcendency of the love.</hi> Chriſt ſaw how <hi>backward</hi> we would be to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> and how hardly we would be brought to perſwade our ſelves, that indeed he did love us at all; therefore it is, he took ſuch care, and made ſuch proviſion, for the perſwading of the hearts of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to cloſe with the truth of this, that he loved them. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>declared thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou haſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me may be in them.</hi> This is the great work which he did himſelf, when he was on earth, and which his Ambaſſadors now doe in his name (now he is in Heaven) viz. <hi>To perſwade the hearts of his that he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.</hi> What a great deal of love was there in that cry of his, when he was on earth, <hi>That if any came to him, he would in no wiſe caſt them out?</hi> And if they did but <hi>thirſt,</hi> they might <hi>come</hi> to him, and <hi>drink?</hi> How did he declare the ſtrength of his love, in perſwading ſoules to come to him, that they might <hi>taſte,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100935:81"/>and <hi>ſee</hi> how he loved them. It had been much, if Jeſus Chriſt would <hi>have given a poor ſoul leave to love him,</hi> and would have accepted it upon his ſeeking to him, but that he ſhould <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>wooe</hi> us to <hi>love him,</hi> and <hi>take paines</hi> to make us <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he doth love us,</hi> This is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love! O beleevers, ſuch is the ſtrength and tranſcendency of the love of Chriſt towards you, that when he was upon earth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he made it his great work, not onely to <hi>tender</hi> love <hi>freely,</hi> but to <hi>perſwade you</hi> to beleeve it <hi>fully.</hi> And now he is gone to Heaven, he hath taken care to appoint <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> and they alwayes in his name doe <hi>beſeech</hi> you to beleeve, that he doth love you: And it is the great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſoul, to fill you, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his own love, but with his Fathers love too, whereſoever the Goſpell of free grace doth ſound, the ſumme thereof is this, <hi>That God ſo loved the world, that hee ſent his Son: And that Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100935:81"/>ſo loved poor ſoules, that he came himſelf, that if any would but beleeve, they might have him, and in him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life and love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all this I might adde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>eaſie price</hi> that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſetteth upon his love, which he tendereth; It is but <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> If any man will but <hi>come</hi> to (his boſome) the fountain of love, he may take <hi>the waters thereof freely;</hi> that fountain is not a <hi>ſealed,</hi> but an <hi>open fountain:</hi> And this is the tranſcendency thereof, that it is <hi>open,</hi> even for thoſe, in whom there was a <hi>fountain of wrath</hi> and enmity flowing up, and that againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. O my brethren! if you did but conſider, that the love of Chriſt <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> that in its nature, it is every way <hi>full,</hi> and in its tender <hi>free;</hi> And that he profereth <hi>rich love</hi> to thoſe, who by nature were the <hi>children of wrath,</hi> and that all this is in a <hi>beſeeching way;</hi> Certainly you muſt conclude, that the love of Chriſt is a tranſcendent love, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100935:82"/>that it paſſeth knowledge. It was the tenderneſſe of the love of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that it paſſed the <hi>love of women; Thy love to me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>was wonderfull, paſſing the love of women,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26. Surely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, the love of Chriſt to you is <hi>wonderfull</hi> (tranſcendently wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) <hi>paſſing the love of women</hi> (paſſing the love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) <hi>comprehending</hi> (as formerly hath been hinted) yea and <hi>ſurmounting any,</hi> or <hi>all the loves of all the creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:</hi> Neither man, nor Angels could, or ever did, expreſſe ſo much love, as Jeſus Chriſt hath not <hi>onely expreſſed,</hi> and declared, <hi>but doth even tender, and beſceeh,</hi> beleeving ſoules to accept of. I ſhall adde no more for the demonſtration thereof, but onely this; That when I have ſaid all that I can (though I had all the tongues both of Men and Angels) of the love of Chriſt, you that finde it in your boſomes, will have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to tell me, that the one half was not told you: For the love of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100935:82"/>Chriſt is ſuch, as all the Saints, who do in the fulleſt meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, are not able to expreſſe it, but muſt be fain to ceaſe ſpeaking, and ſo wrap up their ſoules in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at it, and cry, That it is a <hi>love paſſing knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall briefly anſwer two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which may come in, and be made againſt the truth of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob,</hi> Firſt, it will be <hi>objected,</hi> If the love of Chriſt be ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to beleevers, <hi>Whence then cometh it to paſſe, that he permits them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to lye ſo low, that their enemies triumph, and inſult over them?</hi> Surely will ſome weak <hi>(for weakneſſe is the around of the Objection)</hi> beleever ſay, If Chriſt love me ſo highly, why doth he permit me to lye ſo low? If I be ſo near to his heart, how is it that he ſuffereth wicked men to tread upon me? If he layeth me in his boſome, why is it that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to lye at the worlds feet?</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100935:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>This may conſiſt with love;</hi> tell me <hi>(thou weak ſoul)</hi> was not Chriſt the <hi>dearly beloved</hi> of the Father; and yet did not the father permit wicked men to perſecute him? Canſt thou be <hi>reviled, buffeted ſcourged, or crucified worſe than he?</hi> &amp; yet notwithſtanding all, he was <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Father,</hi> and that in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent manner: in like manner, thou mayeſt be the <hi>beloved of Chriſts ſoul,</hi> and yet be delivered into the <hi>hands of thine-enemies</hi> (as it is) <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7. Nay, this is not onely conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with love, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>It is an act of love;</hi> for while Chriſt permits theſe ſufferings of thine, hee maketh thee like unto himſelf. It is deſired of <hi>Paul,</hi> as it makes him conformable unto Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Even a mourning garment is glorious when it is the ſame that Chriſt weareth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2 But ſome will object further, and ſay, <hi>I do not queſtion whether Chriſt loves me tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of the ſufferings I lye under, but rather becauſe of the deſertions in which I am.</hi> Alas! I queſtion whether he loveth me at all, becauſe <hi>he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth himſelf from me ſo long: much more reaſon have I to queſtion, whether be loveth me tranſcendently; while I ſee him altogether deny me his company.</hi> Indeed in a ſenſe, I think that the love of Chriſt <hi>paſſeth knowledge</hi> (for I know but little of Chriſt) Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee him withdrawn, I will not deny but he hath ſweet ſmiles, but I am a ſtranger to thoſe ſmiles. Time was, when I thought hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me tranſcendently, but now I fear hee loveth me not at all, for hee deſerteth me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſuch a ſoul as objects thus, I would ſay but three words.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:100935:84"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Theſe withdrawings of Chriſt</hi> (whereof thou complaineſt) <hi>are but in ſhew, not in ſubſtance.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> is but abſent in ſhew, when it doth not <hi>ſhine,</hi> it is prerent ſtill, though behind a <hi>cloud:</hi> I have often thought that Chriſts withdrawing, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, may be called rather <hi>his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed preſence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note this</note> 
               <hi>than his real abſence:</hi> He was cloſe by <hi>Mary,</hi> although ſhe did not <hi>ſee him;</hi> He was in the company of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> though <hi>they knew it not:</hi> His preſence was not manifeſt (not becauſe his <hi>perſon</hi> was not there, but) becauſe their <hi>eyes were held,</hi> that they ſhould not know him, <hi>Luke,</hi> 24, <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe withdrawings</hi> (whereof thou complaineſt) <hi>are not total;</hi> Chriſt never ſo withdraweth from the beleever, but he leaveth <hi>ſomething behind,</hi> he <hi>putteth in his hand before he goeth</hi> (as it is <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 4.) And ſurely, his hand was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver empty.<note place="margin">☞ Mind this</note> 
               <hi>If he be abſent in ſhining, he is preſent in ſtrengthning;</hi> though he doth not appear rich in love, yet
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100935:84"/>he is ſtill preſent, upholding thy life. The very breath that thou breatheſt (poor deſerted creature) doth declare that Chriſt is preſent in ſome meaſure: It were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that thou ſhouldeſt breath, if Jeſus were not within thy boſome; thy weepings after him, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that in ſome meaſure he is with thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſts departure will not be final, hee will be found again, though he be not felt now:</hi> And when he cometh he will make rich amends for his abſence. This ſaid Mr. <hi>Peacock</hi> after this deſertion, <hi>The Sea is not more full of water, nor the Sun more full of light, than my heart is full of joy, the joy that I feel in my heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</hi> Ah ſaid another poor ſoul, (that had cryed Chriſt was gone) <hi>He is come, he is come, he hath kiſſed me with the kiſſes of his lips, his love is better than wine, he hath not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, neither will he deceive any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore retort the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus, <hi>Though beleevers give
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100935:85"/>Chriſt occaſion to goe away very often, yet Chriſt never goeth away altogether, but even in his conceived abſence, vouchſafeth a concealed preſence, and at his ſenſible return maketh rich amends for his ſtaying, and going away:</hi> What doe theſe declare, but that his love is tranſcendent, and (as the Text ſaith) <hi>paſſing knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four words I ſhall adde by way of Application, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100935:85"/>with the higheſt, and greateſt degree of curſing that may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for of thoſe three degrees of curſing, which the Jews uſed in their threefold excommunication, this of <hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> was the higheſt; and it includes as much as this, <hi>Let the Lord come, and ſtrike this perſon with eternall perdition.</hi> And tell me. do not thoſe deſervedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to this dreadfull curſe, who do not love ſuch an one as Jeſus Chriſt is; who loveth all his with a tranſcendent love? Mind this, wretches! (you who love not the Lord Jeſus) what can you ſay for your ſelves, that you ſhould not lye under this curſe? Why do not you love Jeſus Chriſt? what reaſon have you for it? Is not he <hi>lovely, fairer than the ſons of men?</hi> Is not he <hi>loving?</hi> Doth not his love to his, paſs the <hi>love of women?</hi> Were Chriſt unkind, you might with ſome <hi>pretence</hi> plead, that you have reaſon not to love him; but being ſo <hi>kind, ſo loving</hi> as that he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100935:86"/>his boſome, and letteth out tranſcendent love to all that are his: Certainly, you may expect, and that juſtly, to be accurſed in this high degree, for not loving Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>See here the true ground of a beleevers glory.</hi> Is it not a ground of glory to be beloved of Chriſt, with ſuch a tranſcendent love as you have heard? Well may beleevers make their <hi>boaſt of Chriſt all the day long;</hi> and well may they glory in the love that they enjoy; for why? that love is tranſcendent, <hi>paſſing knowledge.</hi> None of all the ſonnes or daughters of men have any, ſuch juſt ground of glory (though they ſhould enjoy the love of all the creatures) as beleevers have, who do enjoy only the love of Chriſt. For that love they have, in him, tranſcends, and excells, (and that infinitly) all that love which any can have from all the creatures. Let the world falſly and fondly brag of their creature-loves
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100935:86"/>(and pity them (Oh belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers!) when you ſee them do ſo:) But rejoyce your ſelves in the mean time, <hi>with joy exceeding great, and full of glory:</hi> And the point will bear you out in it, for you have ſuch a love, as is not to be found in all the world beſide. Having the love of Chriſt, you have that love which <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely, beleevers, if the men of the world think they have good ground to glory in this, that they enjoy the <hi>Low love,</hi> (though of ſome ſeeming <hi>great creatures</hi>) you have much more ground to rejoyce, who enjoy this <hi>high love,</hi> of him who is <hi>indeed greater</hi> than all the creatures (Jeſus Chriſt). Do men think they have juſt ground to ſit and glory, in that they ſip the puddle drops of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures loves? Have not you more ground, and that juſter, and truer, to ſing and glory in this, that you drink in the pure love of Jeſus Chriſt? which is ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100935:87"/>ſweet, ſo excellent, and ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, as that it <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in as much as <hi>Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth beleevers with a tranſcendent love;</hi> then ſee here the <hi>riſe and ground of all that which Chriſt doth for them.</hi> You <hi>wonder</hi> beleevers <hi>(at leaſt you might)</hi> and that juſtly; whence it is that Chriſt doth ſo much for you. One while he is <hi>filling</hi> you with his <hi>unſearchable</hi> riches another while he is <hi>crowning</hi> you with <hi>his own glory</hi> Now you have him giving you <hi>choice gifts,</hi> and anon you have him bringing of you <hi>choyce graces:</hi> In this duty you have him imbracing of your ſouls in his arms; And in that duty you find him <hi>kiſſing</hi> you with the <hi>kiſſes of his lips;</hi> and you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry out, <hi>Whence is it that Chriſt doth all this for me!</hi> One while thou art <hi>ſick,</hi> and Chriſt viſiteth thee, and <hi>maketh thy bed,</hi> and <hi>ſitteth by thy bed ſide</hi> other whiles thou <hi>goeſt abroad</hi> and Chriſt walketh with thee, and thou <hi>leaneſt</hi> upon him, as upon thy <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:100935:87"/>Now thou art in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe (it may be under ſome ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment) and Chriſt commeth to thee: And anon it may be thou art in <hi>priſon</hi> (under ſome reſtraint) and Chriſt viſiteth thee there too? And all this maketh thee cry out, <hi>Whence is it, that my Lord ſhould thus come to me?</hi> Why ſee the Point, and in that ſee the cauſe; <hi>He loveth</hi> thee (O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever) and he <hi>loved thee with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love:</hi> And hence it is, that he <hi>doth all</hi> that he doth for thee, and <hi>giveth</hi> all that he beſtoweth on thee. You wonder why Chriſt ſhould ſanctifie ſuch unſanctified hearts as yours are, <hi>&amp; cleanſe by the waſhing of water, and by the word,</hi> ſuch impure ſpirits as yours be: And you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, Whence is it <hi>that the Lord of glory ſhould ſtoop to waſh ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as I am? <hi>Whence is it that he at whoſe feet Angels fall, and bow, ſhould come &amp; waſh the feet of ſuch a creature</hi> as you be? Hence it is (beleevers) Chriſt hath loved you, and that with a <hi>tranſcendent love:</hi> Wonder
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100935:88"/>not therefore henceforth (unleſſe it be with the wondring, why Chriſt doth any thing, or all things, for you) there is a reaſon, yea great reaſon (though <hi>not in</hi> you) yet in <hi>himſelf:</hi> It is this we have been ſpeaking of, <hi>i. e.</hi> the tranſcendent love he beareth to you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, let this inform be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, that <hi>(ſith Chriſt loveth them with a tranſcendent love)</hi> at all times, they <hi>have then a juſt: ground to act their faith upon him in any caſe.</hi> Why is it (O beleever) that thou doubteſt, whether Chriſt will do this for thee, or give that to thee, when as thou conſidereſt he loveth thee with ſuch a tranſcendent love? up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, act your faith (O ye children of faith) in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: what ever it is that you <hi>want,</hi> and he <hi>hath;</hi> what ever it be that thou <hi>wouldeſt have,</hi> and he <hi>can give,</hi> Beleeve that Chriſt will not let thee goe without it; for why, he loveth thee with a tranſcendent love.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:100935:88"/>
            <p>In three caſes more particularly this truth will inform you of the ſure ground that beleevers have to act their faith on Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in caſe of <hi>hearing of their prayers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theſe things I touched at in the firſt Ser. mon, but not ſo fully.</note> Surely he that ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently loveth their perſons, will without doubt hear their prayers, Thou ſayeſt (O beleeving ſoul) thou haſt great neceſſities (and they force thee to make many prayers.) Thou ſayeſt, that Chriſt can help thee at all hands (and therefore thou art <hi>calling upon him at all times</hi>) But thou ſayeſt, will hee hear mee? Why ſhouldeſt thou not beleeve that he will, when thou conſidereſt the tranſcendent love he beareth to thee? The love that is in his <hi>boſome,</hi> towards thee, will <hi>open his ears,</hi> to hear the breathings that come from thee. Indeed, ſometimes hee may <hi>ſeem to be deaf,</hi> and not hear thy prayers; and ſometimes alſo he may <hi>ſeem harſh,</hi> and not accept of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But it is to try thy faith: For notwithſtanding, hee will hear
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100935:89"/>thee, and accept of thee, in what thou deſireſt <hi>according to his will,</hi> for <hi>thy good,</hi> that he may declare his tranſcendent love. You know Chriſt called the <hi>woman of Canaan Dog,</hi> and <hi>ſeemed to ſpeak harſh to her;</hi> and yet even all the while that hee looked (as it were) ſourly upon her, and ſpake (as it were) ſadly againſt her; yet even then did his bowels roule for her, and even then was there love in his boſome to her: And therefore though (for a while) he ſeemed to deny, that hee might try the ſincerity of her faith; yet afterwards he granted her requeſts, that he might declare the reality of his own love. In this caſe therefore you have a ſure ground of faith, O beleevers, Chriſt will not reject your prayers, becauſe he loveth your perſons, and, the more tranſcendent his love is towards the one, the more ſure may you be that he will hear the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In caſe of obtaining
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100935:89"/>counſell from Chriſt, and knowing the mind of Chriſt.</hi> This Point will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us in a ſure ground of faith, and <hi>love.</hi> (O beleever) <hi>love will open Chriſts boſome, and let thee ſee the counſels that are there:</hi> Surely hee will counſel thee in caſe of doubts, becauſe <hi>he</hi> loveth thee, as he doth: Thou ſayeſt here is a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there is a queſtion, and I would fain know the mind of Chriſt concerning this or that: But how can I hope that ever he will open his mind to me, either in the one, or about the other? Why ſayeſt thou ſo (O beleever?) is not his tranſcendent love, a good ground for the acting of thy faith, in this caſe? Verily becauſe <hi>his heart is to thee,</hi> therefore <hi>it will be with thee</hi> (That I may allude to that phraſe. of <hi>Judges</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 15.) How ever <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Sampſon, How canſt thou ſay, I love thee, when thine hart is not with me:</hi> thou haſt no reaſon to ſay, as ſhe ſaid (in ſuch a way as ſhe did:) Thou mayeſt beleeve that his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100935:90"/>
               <hi>heart will be with thee,</hi> becauſe thou heareſt that he loveth thee. I would fain perſwade my own heart, and yours alſo, in theſe times of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and of darkneſſe (in which wee need counſell, and would bee glad to know the Mind of Chriſt more) I would I ſay, perſwade mine own heart, and yours alſo, to this Point, to act faith upon Chriſt in this caſe, whatever the truth of ſuch a <hi>Scripture</hi> be (as you would know) or of ſuch a <hi>queſtion</hi> (as you would fain be <hi>reſolved</hi> in.) Sith Chriſt loveth you with a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love; act faith in this caſe, <hi>That in due time, hee will reveal</hi> even the one, and the other to thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts tranſcendent love giveth a ſure ground of faith <hi>in the caſe of raiſing up of the ſaints out of ſuffering.</hi> Verily (O you children of faith and love) beleeve it, Jeſus Chriſt who loveth you in ſuch a tranſcendent manner (as you have heard) will not let you alwaies be under thoſe great ſufferings
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100935:90"/>which you doe: His great love (for the preſent) maketh him <hi>ſympathize with you (in all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, he is afflicted.)</hi> Men that perſecute you, they perſecute him that loveth you: He looketh upon your ſufferings as his own. (And becauſe heeloveth you ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, hee will ere long tell thoſe that perſecute you, the ſame ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly) beleeve it, Chriſt that hath appeared to you in this, ſaying, <hi>I have loved you with an everlaſting love, and therefore with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> have I drawn you <hi>out of the ſtate of ſin,</hi> will alſo ſay unto you, <hi>I do love you with a tranſcendent love, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the ſame loving kindneſs will I draw you out of the ſtate of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> (I ſay) Act faith (O belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers!) upon this ground of Chriſts <hi>tranſcendent love,</hi> even a ſweet, and a ſingular faith, in the caſe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering you out of ſufferings. As he will not <hi>alwayes ſtrive himſelf</hi> with you, ſo neither alwayes wil he ſuffer wicked men to trample on you,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100935:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe hee knoweth (and his love maketh him <hi>afraid</hi>) leſt your <hi>ſpirits ſhould fail,</hi> as under the one, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Secondly, It may be a word of <hi>Reproof.</hi> This point, that Chriſt loveth his with a tranſcendent love, may juſtly <hi>reprove the world,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Saints themſelves alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It may <hi>reprove the world,</hi> who are ready, not only to think, but to ſay (as hee in the Parable) that Chriſt is an <hi>auſtere man,</hi> Luke 19.21. No my brethren, Chriſt, you ſee, is not auſtere, but ſweet: As his name is, ſo is his nature, love; and that in a tranſcendent manner. Be reproved, <hi>wretches, in entertaining unkind, or reviling thoughts of Chriſt:</hi> You wrong him in his love, and your ſelves in the truth, while you think, or ſay, that hee is not a loving Lord; you ſhall ere long not onely ſee that hee loveth, but that hee loveth all his, with a love paſſing knowledge.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:100935:91"/>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>It reproveth the Saints alſo, who are ready very often to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, if not the reality, yet the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Chriſts love.</hi> Be reproved, for ſaying Chriſt loveth you not at all, or if hee doth, but very little; for you hear, that he loveth even all his with a tranſcendent love. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it is ſadde to ſee, upon what petty poor occaſions, even belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers themſelves are ready to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (at leaſt the greatneſſe) of Chriſts love. If hee denieth them, (though but a vanity) yet becauſe their hearts are ſet upon it ſo much, they think that his heart is not ſet upon them at all, ſuch is their weakneſſe, they are ready to think that Chriſt loveth them but a little, becauſe hee doth not give them, (happily a knife, which hee ſeeth they would uſe to cut their own throat with.) Your boſomes, O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, will hint you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in this caſe, and therefore I paſſe them by: Onely let the word of reproof fall upon you, who for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100935:92"/>any occaſion, whether great or ſmall, dare to queſtion the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of Chriſts love; when as you ſee it to be a clear truth (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with a Sun-beam upon your ſouls and boſomes) that the love he loveth you with, is paſſing knowledge.</p>
            <p>Uſe, Thirdly, This point is a word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to exhort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers (upon the conſideration of this tranſcendent love, which Chriſt beareth to them) to doe at leaſt theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Tremble to think that ever you ſhould ſin againſt him, who loveth you ſo much.</hi> View thy ſins (O beleever) in the light of thy Saviours love; and when thou ſeeſt the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of that love which is in his boſome towards thee, then ſit down, and bleed to behold thy great ſinnings againſt him. Then indeed hath tranſcendent love a ſweet working upon thy ſpirit, when as the thoughts of it can make thee mourn for thy ſinnes.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100935:92"/>How ſweetly did love work upon that woman (who was a <hi>ſinner</hi>) when ſhe taſted the tranſcendent love of her Saviour? The ſight of the great love which was in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome towards her, makes her ſit at his feet, and weep bitterly at the thoughts of her ſins. For the preſent, I will not diſpute the point <hi>whether mourning for ſin before cloſing with Chriſt can bee ſincere,</hi> Sure I am of this, that <hi>after cloſing with Chriſt, and taſting of his love, then mourning for ſin is moſt ſweet:</hi> And though nothing in the world melt the heart for ſinne, yet the thoughts of the love of Chriſt will. Well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, let in then have ſuch a work in your boſomes. O let his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent love (which you may read written with the <hi>blood</hi> of his <hi>heart</hi>) diſſolve thine <hi>adamantine heart:</hi> And let it make thee mourn for thy ſinnes greatly. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have peirced, and mourn</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Why (beleevers) doe you ſee him
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100935:93"/>whom you have peirced with your ſinnes? Do not you mourn, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you ſee him in the light of love? I ſay no more but this, either you have not taſted this tranſcendent love of Chriſt, or elſe your ſpirits are very much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, if the ſenſe and thoughts thereof do not cauſe you to mourn for ſinne. Therefore let this word of Exhortation ſinke deeply into your hearts (O beleevers!) weep, and weep <hi>teares of blood,</hi> to think that ever you ſhould ſinne againſt Jeſus Chriſt, who hath writen in his own blood this truth, that he loveth you with a love <hi>paſſing knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Be exhorted to be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to anſwer this tranſcendent love of your Saviour, with the like.</hi> Let this love of thy Lord, be the <hi>loadſtone of thy love;</hi> Let it conſtrain thee to love him tranſcendently, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee ſo. I know it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thou ſhouldeſt parallel it, (which is the glory of Chriſts love) yet ſtrive at leaſt to imitate it, (which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100935:93"/>will be the glory of thine.) Do not content thy ſelf to love him <hi>little,</hi> that loved thee <hi>much;</hi> Sith Chriſt hath loved thee <hi>richly,</hi> bee aſhamed to love him but <hi>poorly.</hi> Ambition in this reſpect will be a <hi>grace,</hi> if ſo be that the <hi>ſire</hi> of Chriſts love to thee, ſet thee in <hi>flames</hi> of great love to him: O! be ambitious to declare as much as in thee lyeth, the exceeding greatneſſe of thy love to thy Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mirandula</hi> notes it as a badg of love that it maketh the <hi>perſon willing, yea &amp; deſirous to ſuffer for the party belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Beleevers, Chriſts love to you, had ſuch a work as that, and if your love to him hath not yet riſen ſo high as to <hi>deſire</hi> to ſuffer for him, yet let it at leaſt riſe thus high, as to be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer</hi> any thing for him, <hi>if hee call thee</hi> to it; It will be a ſweet, and a ſure character of love.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt wrote a letter of love to thee in his own blood: So do thou (upon occaſion) write a letter of love back to him, in the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100935:94"/>ſame <hi>rubrick. The love of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>conſtraineth us, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we thus judge, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 14. the conſideration of Chriſts love had a <hi>conſtraining power</hi> upon <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, &amp; he could not chuſe but judge this, <hi>that if Jeſus Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dyed for him, hee ſhould be willing to dye for Chriſt.</hi> Then is a Chriſtian ſweetly exerciſed, when as the Golden ball of divine love, is toſſed too and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, between Chriſts boſome, and his. Let this therefore ſink into your ſpirits, labour to anſwer (O belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) this tranſcendent love of Chriſt towards you, <hi>which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>upon all occaſions, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this tranſcendent love. Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus me ſibilat, &amp;c.</hi> (as the miſer ſaith) people deride mee abroad, but I comfort my ſelfe, when I come home, (he meant by looking into his boxes, and there ſeeing his gold.) Beleevers, though the world deride you abroad, yet you may have recourſe to this love of Chriſt,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100935:94"/>and comfort your ſelves when you come home: To look as it were into the glorious box (Chriſts boſome) and there ſee that, which (I am ſure to thee) is better than gold, <hi>id eſt,</hi> his <hi>grace.</hi> Weak people are thus farre wiſe, as they have their little bottles of ſpirits, and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to carry about with them, to refreſh them when they are faint; Beleevers, you (eſpecially you that are weak) imitate their wiſdome: Let this <hi>bottle of Chriſts tranſcendent love,</hi> alwayes be in thy boſome, and have recourſe to this; Refreſh thy ſpirits upon all occaſions (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when thou beginneſt to faint) and without doubt, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing power in this tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of Chriſt, to keep up your hearts from fainting under troubles (as we ſhall ſee in the next point, when we come to it.) Jeſus Chriſt in his trouble had recourſe to his fathers love, why then in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have not you recourſe to Chriſts love?</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100935:95"/>
            <p>Fourthly, (In as much as Chriſt loveth all his with a tranſcendent love) let it <hi>be your care (O beleevers) to imitate your Saviour:</hi> Love all his as he doth, with ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.2. 1 Joh. 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>Beloved, if Chriſt have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, we ought then to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> At leaſt (O beleevers) be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to have <hi>ſalt in your ſelves, and to love one another,</hi> and that very dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſith Jeſus Chriſt doth the like: <hi>Be ye followers of Chriſt</hi> (in this) <hi>as dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> children,</hi> and be you walkers <hi>in love one to another, as Chriſt hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you all;</hi> who ever they bee that are beleevers, Chriſt loveth them very dear, becauſe they are his: He doth ſo, why ſhould not you? O that where ever you ſee the light of Chriſts love ſhining upon any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that there you would cauſe your love to ſhine alſo upon the ſame: Eſpecially take heed, that you do not frown upon thoſe, on whom Chriſt doth ſmile. You have heard (and therefore mind it) that Chriſt loveth all his with a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent

Who doth not bleed to ſee one beleever to write a book of revilings
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100935:96"/>againſt another, when as you look upon the Goſpell (as a glorious book of love) writted by Chriſt to them all; <hi>Tell it not in Gath, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it not in the ſtreets of Askelon:</hi> O! let not <hi>the daughters of the unbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved triumph, to ſee you who are the highly beloved ones of Ieſus Chriſt, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and reviling one another.</hi> I ſay no more but this, ſith Jeſus Chriſt doth love al the Saints, and every believer, with a tranſcendent love, do you who are beleevers (and ſo ſhare in the ſweetneſſe of this truth) do the like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall adde but a word of <hi>perſwaſion,</hi> and let it be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all <hi>thoſe, who as yet are ſtrangers to Ieſus Chriſt, to come in unto him.</hi> O that you could behold the glorious beames of tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love towards all beleevers, doubtleſs ſuch a ſight as that, could not chuſe but work upon your hearts, and ſtrangely draw your ſpirits to cloſe with him, who is ſo lovely in himſelf, and ſo loving unto his wandring ſoules, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100935:96"/>erre up and down the Wilderneſſe of the world: <hi>Return (yee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) unto holds of love, kiſſe the Son,</hi> imbrace Jeſus Chriſt, know, hee is the Lord of love: One who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all that come to him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and then loveth them all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently: I fear you are ignorant of this truth, that Chriſt loveth his with a love <hi>paſſing knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may be your ignorance of this, keepeth you from cloſing with him; But know it now, and be perſwaded to come to Chriſt; to cloſe with him, to imbrace his Goſpell, to love his truth, to be converſant in his ordinances, as knowing, if you be, you ſhall have love from him, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Bee contented now to break off from the wayes of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and come into the <hi>wayes of righteouſneſſe;</hi> Bee contented to bid the <hi>creature</hi> adieu, and now be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>imbrace</hi> Chriſt. do not ſay if you take up <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Goſpell</hi> and in his <hi>wayes, Friends</hi> will

               <hi>leave</hi> you, and the <hi>World</hi> will <hi>loath</hi> you, and the <hi>Devill</hi> will ſtirre up the <hi>Sonnes of Belial</hi> againſt you: It matters not, though the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>leave</hi> you, Chriſt will <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi> you; Though they <hi>loath</hi> you, Chriſt will <hi>love</hi> you. And what need you fear the riſing up of the <hi>Sonnes of Belial,</hi> when you ſhall enjoy the loves of Chriſts boſome? <hi>Heare and give eare, (O ye children of folly) bee wiſe at leaſt</hi> once, and you ſhall taſte love. Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you all, whoever you bee, come to him, imbrace him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, and you ſhall find him loving you tranſcendently. I have ſaid all (and happy I were, and you too) if I could but prevail with you to bee drawn to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with theſe cords of love.</p>
            <p>However you are ſtrangers to it now, yet if you would but come in, you ſhould know the love of Chriſt, and know the truth of this point. Your

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100935:98"/>
               <hi>vanity in our deſiring knowledge;</hi> Wee are all of us apt, either to deſire the knowledge of that that is <hi>above us</hi> (and ſo unattainable) or elſe <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us</hi> (and in that reſpect not ſo much deſirable.) It was this <hi>golden apple</hi> of knowledge, which was ſo taking, and tempting with our Grandmother <hi>Eve,</hi> that albeit the beſt that ſhee got by eating that apple, was but the <hi>knowledge of evill,</hi> (which wee had all been better without) yet ſhee was drawn to eat of the Apple: Not onely as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of its being pleaſant to the taſte, but becauſe it <hi>was deſirable to make one wiſe:</hi> And ſurely; as our <hi>Grandmother</hi> did eat thoſe <hi>ſowre grapes,</hi> ſo we all <hi>her children</hi> have ever ſince had our <hi>teeth ſet on edge</hi> with the ſame deſire.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that too too often, out of an eager deſire, and affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge, we are apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one hand for to five <hi>too high,</hi> and to pry into thoſe hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which God hath not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100935:99"/>or elſe on the other hand, wee are apt to ſtoop too low (and to dive into <hi>niceties</hi> and vanities, at leaſt into the knowledge of ſuch things in which we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) but as the Apoſtle doth ſay) I ſhall ſhew you <hi>a more excellent way;</hi> by declaring how you may poiſe your deſire of knowledge, ſo as that you ſhould be neither <hi>too high,</hi> nor <hi>too low</hi> in the purſuit thereof: Doe not ſay therefore, <hi>who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,</hi> to bring down Jeſus Chriſt from above, and to reveale the knowledge of hidden glories, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable myſteries? Neither ſay, <hi>who ſhall deſcend?</hi> to raiſe him up from beneath, but <hi>remember the word</hi> (the Scripture) <hi>is nigh, even the Goſpel which we preach:</hi> Labour to know it, and you ſhal know enough, not only as to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but even as to the <hi>perfection</hi> of your knowledge. Chriſt who is the <hi>Wiſdome of God, and in whom are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome, and knowledge,</hi> is fully and clearly revealed in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100935:99"/>Goſpel, and by the ſtudy and the knowledge of it, wee ſhall come to the knowledge of him. Now of all knowledge, the knowledge of Chriſt, as it is moſt ſacred, ſo it is moſt <hi>ſatisfactory:</hi> And of all things in Chriſt, the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>love:</hi> And as that is moſt <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> ſo it is moſt <hi>ſweet.</hi> It is this knowledge, which the Apoſtle here prayeth that the Epheſians might obtain, (and by conſequence that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which all Chriſtians ought to deſire, and labour for.) It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you not ſo much to know Arts and Sciences (though in themſelves, and their way, they are neceſſary, and of worth) neither doth it concein you (at leaſt) ſo much, to be acquainted with other truths of the Scriptures (which in their place are very precious) But this is that which doth ſo mainly concern you, <hi>viz.

            <p>Our third Point in order taken up, and to bee ſpoken to from theſe

            </p>
            <p>We have already endeavoured to hold out, at leaſt, a <hi>beame of light</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſcovery of that <hi>boſome-love,</hi> that is in Chriſt towards his: And at this time my deſire is, to hint ſomething, which may at leaſt put you on to endeavour to make a further diſcovery of the riches, and the glory, and the tranſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that love: For my deſigne is to make it appear, That <hi>the ſtudy for the knowledge thereof,</hi> is of very <hi>choice, ſpeciall, and neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you all.</hi>

               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100935:100"/>There are divine, and infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions in the love of Chriſt, and it is our duty to labour for the knowledge of all theſe: We ſhould ſtrive to be able to <hi>meaſure</hi> both the <hi>length</hi> and the <hi>breadth,</hi> yea and alſo to <hi>take the height,</hi> and to <hi>ſound the depth</hi> of the love of Chriſt: Chriſts boſome is a very glorious <hi>Mine</hi> of love, and it concerneth us to <hi>dig</hi> very deep into it, and not content our ſelves with a bare diſcovery of that <hi>Golden Oare,</hi> or <hi>vein</hi> of love, which is upon the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> or top of the ſame <hi>Mine;</hi> and in which we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcover, as it were in the very <hi>letter</hi> of the Goſpel; but it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to endeavour to attain unto the <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>myſteriall diſcoveries thereof,</hi> which Saints by the light of the Spirit come to attain.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2 A ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</note>2 Yea, and not only ſo, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to endeavour to get an <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge</hi> of this love; That as the Painter curiouſly painted love, by drawing the type of it out of his own boſome; So we in like
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100935:101"/>manner may be able by our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſcourſes to paint forth, and to declare what the love of Chriſt is, taking eſpecially the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, out of our own boſomes, our own experiences. Divines obſerve that the Scriptures own not any thing for knowledge (at leaſt ſaving) which is not experimentall. And certainly that knowledge of the love of Chriſt (whereof we ſhall now ſpeak) ought to be, not only a bare <hi>head knowledge,</hi> but eſpecially a <hi>heart</hi> knowledge, an experimentall knowledge; This I thought good to adde for the explication of the ſubject of the Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>predicate</hi> (or the thing that we do affirm of this knowledge of the love of Chriſt) you may do well, for the clearer apprehending thereof, to take it in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>This knowledge is of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> There are many things, the knowledge whereof may be <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> but not of ſuch <hi>concernment.</hi> But
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100935:101"/>this knowledge whereof we ſpeak, is ſuch a knowledge, as not onely may be <hi>expedient</hi> for us to know, but alſo of <hi>concernment</hi> for us that wee ſhould know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay it is of <hi>neceſſary concernment;</hi> ſome knowledge may bee of <hi>accidentall concernment</hi> to be known, which is not of <hi>neceſſary concernment:</hi> ſome things indeed as being accidentall to ſome greater truth, and the diſcovery thereof, are in that reſpect of concernment, to be known; (and ſo may concern a man to endeavour for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof) But now this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath a <hi>neceſſity laid upon it;</hi> and <hi>woe</hi> be to every ſoule that knoweth not the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I adde, it is of neceſſary concernment <hi>for every Chriſtian;</hi> ſome truths there are, which albeit they may be of neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome perſons, who are as it were anointed with an higher anointing, and imployed in a more ſpeciall way (as officers in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100935:102"/>Church, &amp;c.) may yet not bee of ſuch neceſſary concernment to all: But now this knowledge, (whereof we are ſpeaking) is of neceſſary concernment; for <hi>every ſoule</hi> that is named by the name of Chriſt, (and ſo <hi>pretends to be a Chriſtian</hi>) but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>every ſoul that is united to Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (and ſo is <hi>indeed a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>) ought to labour for a ſolid knowledge of the love of Chriſt. As the <hi>Fathers</hi> in Chriſts School, are not <hi>above</hi> this knowledge; ſo neither the <hi>babes</hi> and children in Chriſts School are <hi>beneath</hi> it, but <hi>all, even the one and the other,</hi> are bound, and it lyeth upon them, as that which doth <hi>concern</hi> them very near, and very <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to know this love of Chriſt, <hi>which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One word I ſhal only adde by way of Caution; I do not ſpeak, neither would I have you underſtand mee, as if this were the only knowledge to bee laboured for. Indeed it is the <hi>ſovereign,</hi> but not the <hi>ſole</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which Chriſtians ſhould
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100935:102"/>deſire, and endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>In all that therefore I ſhall ſpeak, I deſire to be underſtood, not <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,</hi> ſhutting out other truths, but as incluſively, and eminently driving at this in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And as Chriſt ſaid with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>doing,</hi> Thoſe things, you ought to have done (that is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) and not leaving the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done (<hi>i.e.</hi> altogether neglect) I ſay in like manner of knowing, the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, you ought eſpecially to labour for (as a thing of more choice, and <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and <hi>neceſſary concernment</hi>) but you are not altogether to neglect the knowledge of other Goſpell-truths, as if they were of no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or of no neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Proof</hi> I ſhall not need to adde many places (it being ſo fully laid down in this;) Certainly this <hi>wiſe Apoſtle Paul,</hi> would never have ſo earneſtly, and particularly begged
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100935:103"/>of God, that the Epheſians might <hi>know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> if it were not of ſpeciall and neceſſary concernment for them. I ſhall only adde to this his <hi>deſire</hi> for the Epheſians, that <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of his for himſelf (which he expreſſeth to the Corinthians) <hi>I am determined</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt crucified (as I hinted once before) is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt in his love; Though the whole life of Jeſus Chriſt, was but (as it hath been ſhewed) like one great Sermon of love, yet the death of Chriſt was as it were a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and clearer Sermon of love, than all his life was. Never did Chriſt ſpeak love, more fully, and more freely, than when he was as it were in that <hi>Pulpit,</hi> the Croſſe: Now then, if certainly <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to know nothing but this;</hi> wee may ſafely conclude, both from <hi>his determination</hi> for himſelf, and <hi>his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100935:103"/>deſire</hi> for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that the <hi>knowledge of Chriſts tranſcendent love,</hi> (eſpecially in a clear experimentall way) <hi>is of neceſſary concernment for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall offer ſome reaſons to make this point yet clearer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The knowledge of the love of Chriſt contains in it the ſumme of the Goſpell. (Chriſt being the ſum of the Goſpell, and love the ſum of Chriſt.</hi>) God ſo loved the World, that hee <hi>gave Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt ſo loved the world, that hee <hi>gave himſelf,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in it the <hi>morrow</hi> and <hi>pith</hi> of all the Goſpell: This little word <hi>love</hi> (written in the golden letters of free-grace upon the boſome of Jeſus Chriſt) is an <hi>epitomy of the Goſpell:</hi> Look as <hi>O love the father, is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law; ſo Chriſts love to us,</hi> is the fullneſſe of the Goſpell. You have <hi>done the Law,</hi> if you <hi>love</hi> God ſincerely, and you <hi>underſtand the Goſpel,</hi> if you know Chriſts love ſoundly.</p>
            <p>Secondly The knowledge of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100935:104"/>Chriſts love is of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, becauſe <hi>it containeth in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the chiefeſt motive to duty.</hi> You will never doe duty (at leaſt with that <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> in your own ſpirits which you <hi>ſhould</hi>) and with that <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God, which you would) if you do not act from a <hi>principle of love.</hi> Now the love of Chriſt known to us, is that which chiefly enflameth our love to him; what was the reaſon, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that love that God ſhewed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he <hi>was a child, &amp; taught him to goe, taking him by the armes,</hi> had not that impreſſion upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> which it ſhould have? the Prophet hinteth the reaſon, becauſe, <hi>Iſrael knew it not, Hoſ.</hi> 11.3. God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not underſtand his love; and therefore it was that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> would not walk anſwerable thereunto. In like manner, wee ſhall never walk anſwerable by doing our duty, <hi>(for I take duty, to be at leaſt an anſwer of love)</hi> in caſe wee doe not know what the love is,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100935:104"/>wherewithall Chriſt hath loved us. <hi>Paul</hi> was more abundant than all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100935:105"/>for a beleever to know it, in as much as he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; verily this is life eternall to know the love of Chriſt which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge, If it bee of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary concernment for the ſoul to live, it muſt be alſo of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to know Chriſts love, in as much as without the one, hee cannot enjoy the other. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) but how? <hi>by the faith</hi> (now faith is but a higher degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of the love of Chriſt</hi>) <hi>of the Son of God, who loveth me.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> preſſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the ſincere keeping of the Law, <hi>for it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your life;</hi> In like manner may we preſſe Chriſtians to the ſerious knowledge of Chriſts love, becauſe it is our ſoules life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The knowledge of Chriſts love, is the foundation of a ſoules joy, and Chriſtians comfort,</hi> and therefore of ſuch neceſſary concernment. The reaſon why the Saints are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſad, is becauſe they doe not know the love of Chriſt, (at.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100935:105"/>leaſt in all the dimenſions thereof,) Hence it is that Peace is joyned with love, ſomtimes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: <hi>Peace</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>bee to the brethren,</hi> but from whence? from this (as it is added) <hi>and love from God the Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 6.23. the hearts of beleevers would be at <hi>Peace,</hi> if ſo be they did but fully underſtand the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt. O (ſaith the ſoul) of that beleever, and of this beleever, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they live ſweetly upon Chriſts love, becauſe they have it, but I go ſadly in the want of Chriſts love, becauſe I think there is none for me: The ſoul is ſad, becauſe it ſeeth not the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the love of Chriſt: I (ſaith another ſoul) ſuch an one who hath <hi>more grace</hi> than I, and ſuch an one who hath <hi>leſſe ſinne</hi> than I have, he may live joyfully becauſe of Chriſts love, but I muſt goe ſadly becauſe I fear hee will not love me. The reaſon of this ſoules ſadneſſe, is becauſe it knoweth not the fullneſſe of love,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100935:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>that is in Chriſt, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof; without doubt, did we but know the love of Chriſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do, wee ſhould not be ſo ſad, ſo often as we are. That <hi>boſome Diſciple John</hi> (who knew much of the love of Jeſus, and had declared the knowledge of it unto others) he ſaith it was for this end: <hi>theſe things write I unto you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that your joy might bee full;</hi> Sith therefore the joy and the comfort of our ſoules is built upon the love of Chriſt, as its foundation, it doth neceſſarily concern us, to get the knowledge thereof.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the knowledge of Chriſts love, is of neceſſaay concernment, becauſe it is <hi>the riſe of Chriſtian thankfullneſſe.</hi> Hence it is that thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe ſprings, it is from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence it floweth. Thoſe ſoules will bee moſt thankfull for the love of Chriſt, that underſtand is moſt; <hi>Ignorance begets ingratitude, but knowledge maketh thankfull:</hi> Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoule, <hi>and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100935:106"/>not all his benefits;</hi> Men will not be thankfull for that which they do forger; neither can men remember that which they do not know: All that Chriſt looks for from the Saints, is this, that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the tranſcendent love he beareth unto them. Wee will never be able to ſing <hi>glory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be to him, who hath loved us,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee know how hee loved us. Look as a Lark, at the diſcovery of the light of the day, aſcends chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and chirping; and the lighter the Heavens appear, the higher ſhe aſcends, and the ſweeter ſhee ſings; In like manner the ſoul, who knoweth the love of Chriſt, and ſeeth the light thereof, mounteth and ſingeth, and the more bright the beames of Chriſts-boſome love ſhines in upon them, the higher is the ſoul elevated, and the ſweeter it doth chirp, and chant that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſong of thankfulneſſe unto Chriſt. You are bound beleevers, to thank Chriſt for his love, but you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100935:107"/>will never to purpoſe go about to cancell that bond, if ſo be you doe not know the tranſcendency of that love with which hee hath bound you.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Chriſts love is all the legacy he hath left Chriſtians.</hi> Surely it is of neceſſary concernment, for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to know that which Chriſt <hi>left</hi> them in his <hi>will.</hi> He hath not left them ample poſſeſſions, nor brave buildings in this world: (his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (though he loved him) left him not a houſe to put his own head in here) but <hi>dear love, rich love, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent love, love paſſing knowledge,</hi> this Chriſt hath left to beleevers (as his father left him) <hi>as the father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, Joh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Aske the widdow, whether it doth not neceſſarily concern her, to know that which her husband left her; Aske the child whether there lie a neceſſity upon him to know that which his father left him, both the one and the other will ſay, yes. Why beleevers, your <hi>everlaſting father,</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100935:107"/>your <hi>ſoules husband,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, hath left you nothing but his love, ſurely it is neceſſary that you ſhould know it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>As the ſoul is filled with the knowledge of the love of Chriſt; ſo it is filled with the fulneſſe of God.</hi> You empty creatures, doth it not <hi>concern you,</hi> (and that <hi>neceſſarily</hi>) to be filled with the divine fulneſſe, the fulneſſe of God? ſurely you will ſay, yes; then know, it doth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily concern you to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qainted with the love of Chriſt; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that you cannot be ſo filled. Some have thought, that <hi>knowledge is nothing but an union between the thing known, and the underſtanding;</hi> Hence it is, that they ſay and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that by how much any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of knowledge, by ſo much they partake of fulneſſe: God is love, and if the knowledge of Gods love be the union thereof with the ſoul, then certainly, by how much we know the one, by ſo much wee partake, and are filled with the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100935:108"/>other. Obſerve how the Apoſtle therefore joyneth this in the Text, <hi>To know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you may bee filled with all the fullneſſe of God.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop of this knowledge of the love of Chriſt, tendeth towards the filling of the ſoul with the fulneſſe of God: ſurely therefore to be <hi>filled,</hi> and to be filled with <hi>God,</hi> and to bee filled with the <hi>fulneſſe of God,</hi> yea with <hi>all the fulneſſe</hi> of God, being ſo neceſſary for every ſoul as it is, and the knowledge of Chriſts love being ſo advantagious to this, It muſt needs bee a thing of ſpeciall concernment for every Chriſtian, to labour to know the love of Chriſt, <hi>which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly now for application:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it may ſerve for a uſe of <hi>Lamentation,</hi> that notwithſtanding the knowledge of the love of Chriſt is thus neceſſary, yet</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this knowledge hath been <hi>little ſtudied.</hi> Secondly, though it ſhould be much ſtudied, yet it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100935:108"/>
               <hi>can be little obtained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt,, I ſay, <hi>it hath been but little ſtudied.</hi> Men have been very ſwift in ſearching after other truths, but they have been ſlow in ſearching after this. An <hi>ample, exact diſcovery of this love of Chriſt,</hi> may well be ſet down among the <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derata, i.e.</hi> the deſirables of Divines, it having been ſo little handled by any. Indeed much of the <hi>Law</hi> (in the point of duty) hath been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but little of the Goſpel, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this point of Chriſts love) hath been inquired into. I doe not know any one Authour of eminency, (indeed as yet I have met with none at all) who on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath handled, or diſcourſed exactly concerning this ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> the tranſcendency of the love of Chriſt; I have heard, that that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divine Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> was wont to complain of the great defect this way: Surely it is very ſad to think that the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, being of ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100935:109"/>neceſſary and high concernment, hath been ſo little inquired into; <hi>O what a gallant Goſpel-deſigne were it, for ſome one who is acquainted with the Spirit in a large meaſure, to goe over the whole hiſtory of the Goſpel, and to obſerve the glorious ſhinings of the love of Chriſt</hi> to beleevers in <hi>all.</hi> It would bee precious if ſome would take it in hand, and perfect it to the purpoſe: But it is ſad to think it hath been neglected ſo long.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may lament, not onely to think this knowledge hath been but little advanced by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of any, but <hi>eſpecially, that it is ſuch, that after all labour it can be but little gained.</hi> We may weep to think, how little of the love of Chriſt it is, that thoſe who have. moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, doe, or can know. We read of a Book which was ſealed, and <hi>John</hi> wept much (ſaith the Text) becauſe no man was <hi>found worthy in heaven or in earth, that was able to open the Book, or to look thereon.</hi> Beloved, the heart of Chriſt may be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100935:109"/>compared to a glorious Book, in which the myſterious hiſtory of his tranſcendent love is written: But alas! who is there, not onely in earth, but in heaven, that is able to open this Book, and to diſcover the myſteries thereof? Beloved, when we ſhall come to heaven, wee ſhall then be in a capacity of more perfect knowledge of the love of Chriſt: But alas! even <hi>then</hi> wee ſhall never be able to comprehend the love of Chriſt in the perfection thereof, that is, ſo fully as it may be known; Then indeed we ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it in the perfection of <hi>our knowledge (i.e.)</hi> ſo far as it can bee known by the finite knowledge of creatures; but yet then we ſhall not know it ſo full as it is. The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak of knowledge (as they doe of ſeeing:<note place="margin">Duplex plenitudo ſcientioe, &amp; viſionis, viz Plenitudo
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>Subjecti.</hi>

                     <item>2 <hi>Objecti.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </note>) There is a twofold fulneſs of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>a fulneſſe in regard of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (i.e.)</hi> ſuch a fulneſs as regards the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>a fulneſſe of knowledge in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100935:110"/>regard of the ſubject in which it is.</hi> Now for mine own part, I incline (at leaſt for preſent, to conclude, that although without doubt, there ſhall be a fullneſſe of knowledge of Chriſt in reſpect of <hi>our knowledge (i.e.)</hi> according to the utmoſt bounds, or extents, which our knowledge, when it is perfected to the higheſt, is capable of; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>in regard of the fulneſſe of knowledge, as it relates to the thing it ſelf,</hi> viz. The love of Chriſt, <hi>quoad eſſentiam, &amp; virtutem intenſivam, &amp; extenſivam (i.e.)</hi> when it is conſidered ſo far forth as it may be had unto all the effects, and purpoſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that knowledge doth extend it ſelf; this I ſay, I think wee ſhall not have, but to all eternity, wee ſhall be admiring and adoring of this love of Chriſt <hi>which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore then wee muſt needs lament to conſider, that although the knowledge of the love of Chriſt be of ſuch neceſſary concernment,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100935:110"/>yet it hath been but <hi>little ſearched after</hi> by many; and when wee ſhall make the greateſt ſearch after it, we <hi>ſhall never be able fully to attain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Secondly, it may be a uſe of <hi>Reproof</hi> unto thoſe who neglect this ſtudy of the knowledge of the love of Chriſt altogether. Many there are, who are <hi>little</hi> in the ſtudy of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, leſſe</hi> in the ſtudy of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but, <hi>leaſt of all</hi> in this, which is the light, and luſtre, and glory of all the Goſpel, the love of Chriſt to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: And I cannot chuſe but think thoſe blame-worthy, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, who in theſe times ſpeak much of their parts and abilities in the beating out of ſome truths mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controverſall (which yet I ſpeak not againſt in its place) and yet neglect this knowledge which is of ſuch neceſſary concernment. I doe not altogether blame thoſe who ſtudy this <hi>headſhip</hi> of Chriſt (I mean this Government) it being I think this <hi>preſent truth,</hi> which is moſt controverted in theſe times;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100935:111"/>yet notwithſtanding, to ſtudy ſo far the <hi>head</hi> of Chriſt, as to neglect his <hi>heart,</hi> ſo far to mind his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to neglect his <hi>love,</hi> is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, a thing to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>But much more are thoſe to bee reproved, who ſtudy neither the one, nor the other, but ſpend all their time, their pains, and their parts, in <hi>controverſies,</hi> and <hi>niceties,</hi> prying either into unrevealed <hi>poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or being buſied about <hi>needleſſe queſtions,</hi> neglecting, in the mean time, this one neceſſary thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of the love of Chriſt. How many are there that may (as one ſaid of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) bee like unto Travellers, or men in a journey, who have good bread about them, but goe gnawing, and biting upon hard ſtones? ſo indeed ſome men, who have (at leaſt means to have) the <hi>bread of life, Chriſts love,</hi> but they neglect it, and ſpend their time in gnawing upon hard trivialls, at
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100935:111"/>leaſt not <hi>uſefull queſtions.</hi> Be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, O all ye, who ſo far ſpend your ſelves, about the obtaining of any knowledge, when in the mean time, you doe neglect the ſtudy of this knowledge, (the love of Chriſt) which is of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we ſhall adde a word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to ſtir up all to the ſtudy of the love of Chriſt. You who have <hi>ſpent,</hi> or rather <hi>miſpent,</hi> many a precious hour in reading of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſes, and fond hiſtories, of feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loves, yea, you who ſpend all your time, though it be about ſome matters of concernment, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting this; be ſtirred up now, to lay out your ſelves in the ſtudy of that which is ſweet, and neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtudy of <hi>the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge;</hi> you muſt conceive, that (as I hinted in the explication) my deſire is, that you would labour to be <hi>well verſed,</hi> and to be <hi>exact ſtudents</hi> in this buſineſſe; I would not have you content your
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100935:112"/>ſelves in ſome <hi>generalls,</hi> but labour to make <hi>a particular diſcovery of the love of Chriſt</hi> in its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> in its <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and in its <hi>ſundry act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi> and <hi>declarations:</hi> O remember, that this knowledge includeth in it all that knowledge which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known for ſalvation.</p>
            <p>When you have ſtudied it well, you ſhall find that there is nothing in the whole doctrine of ſalvation, which is not comprehended in this love of Chriſt (as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath well obſerved upon the place) This knowledge is both <hi>ſafe and ſweet;</hi> it is not ſuch knowledge as wil <hi>puffe up the head,</hi> but it will <hi>purifie the heart:</hi> I doe not doubt that any can grow <hi>wanton,</hi> who attaineth to any <hi>ſpirituall ſaving degree</hi> of this knowledge. The <hi>love of Chriſt will conſtrain to duty, and reſtrain from ſin;</hi> therefore betake your ſelves to this ſtudy above all others.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall offer ſomething as <hi>meanes</hi> to help you, and as <hi>motives</hi> to encourage you. Onely by <hi>way of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100935:112"/>caution,</hi> learn to take <hi>heed of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your ſelves too much;</hi> Doe not think that you ſhall ever come to <hi>perfection of knowledge in this point,</hi> at leaſt while you are in this life: It is a point which may take up the ſtudy <hi>of all the Saints;</hi> (happily ſo much may bee couched in the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> of this chapter, that you may bee able to <hi>comprehend with all Saints.</hi>) He ſpeaketh, as if it were a Text, about which, not onely every Saint is to ſet himſelf, but as which doth require <hi>all the abilities of all the Saints.</hi> Look as ſome great point doth require the abilities of many Scholars (and all little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when joyned together) to make a good diſcovery thereof: ſuch is the love of Chriſt, as that <hi>all the Saints</hi> may well ſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſtudy of it, and when they have brought all their notes together, and added all their ſtudies together, they will bee able to make (at leaſt in this life) but a very little diſcovery thereof. Therefore take
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100935:113"/>heed of promiſing your ſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Now I adde this <hi>caution, not to deter you from the ſtudy,</hi> but <hi>to make you the more ſerious in it;</hi> and alſo to <hi>keep you from caſting of it off, after you have begun to underſtand it.</hi> It is with ſome Saints, as with Scholars, who having ſet about ſome ſtudy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome progreſſe, find the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo hard, and high, as that they can never come to the perfect knowledge thereof, they begin to ſlack in their indeavours, and to caſt it off: But now beloved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it beforehand, that you may not afterwards caſt off the ſtudy of the love of Chriſt, when you have ſpent your ſelves to the uttermoſt, you ſhall never come to a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Yet let me adde this, the leaſt beames of the love of Chriſt have ſo much light in them, as that they will bee very ſweet, and every peece or part of this knowledge, will be of very ſpeciall worth: yea, the low,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100935:113"/>and imperfect knowledge of the love of Chriſt (if experimentall, and ſpirituall) is of infinite more value, than the high and perfect knowledge of Tenne thouſand things beſides: Yea, and one thing more let me adde, it is poſſible for you to attain to a very ſweet and ſatisfactory degree of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But what ſhall I do to attain a ſatisfactory degree of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the love of Chriſt, ſo as that albeit I cannot attain to the knowledge thereof fully, yet I may be able to attain ſo much, as may make me (at leaſt) ſay, as it is in the Text, <hi>The love of Chriſt paſſeth knowledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that I ſhall offer ſome directions, as concerning the <hi>means</hi> and helps how you may obtain the knowledge of the love of Chriſt; And alſo as concerning the <hi>manner</hi> how wee ſhould carry our ſelves in that ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the <hi>meanes,</hi> I ſhall name
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100935:114"/>theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Be much converſant in reading of the Goſpel.</hi> How ever the Bible in general, doth give teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>perſon</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo in ſome meaſure concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>affection</hi> to the Saints; yet the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (of all parts of the Bible) doth in a more <hi>ample, clear,</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Way,</hi> hold out the love of Chriſt to beleevers. That which all the Prophets ſpake of him, or of his love, is ſo <hi>allegoricall,</hi> and ſo darkly, as that it is not eaſie (at leaſt for every one) to obſerve the light of Chriſts love, ſo clearly ſhining in them. Indeed the <hi>ſun ſhine</hi> of Chriſts love is in the <hi>firmament</hi> of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> but as it is there, it is much <hi>clouded</hi> &amp; much veiled. But in the Firmament of the <hi>new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> it ſhineth in its full <hi>brightneſſe; luſter,</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> And therefore bee moſt coverſant in reading of it. And while you read the Goſpel, be ſure to carry this along with you, that all that which you ſhall read there, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100935:114"/>ther in <hi>the life, or death of Chriſt, is ſtill to be underſtood, as a demonſtration of his love to beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou wouldeſt know the love of Chriſt, be ſure to <hi>labour to get into the boſome of Chriſt;</hi> that Soul knoweth little of Chriſts love in the power, and ſweetneſs, and Spirituality thereof, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only Chriſt in his <hi>head,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without him, and is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the knowledge of Chriſt in his <hi>heart,</hi> as <hi>being in him.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therefore to have Chriſt <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in thee</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) otherwiſe all that knowledge which thou haſt of the love of Chriſt, will be to little or no purpoſe. Look as Jeſus Chriſt did therefore know the Father moſt, becauſe (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>he lay in the Fathers boſome.</hi> In like manner do thou labour to be in the boſome of Jeſus Chriſt, that thou mayeſt the better know what is his love to beleevers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſule with Beleevers.</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:100935:115"/>Ask thoſe <hi>objects of love,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of Chriſt to them. They that have had experience of his love, can beſt inform thee. I make no queſtion, but that a poor beleever, who hath <hi>taſted of the love of Chriſt, and in ſome meaſure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the tranſcendent ſweetneſſe thereof,</hi> is farre better able to helpe thee in this great ſtudy of the love of Chriſt, than the greateſt <hi>Scholar</hi> in the world is, who it may bee hath read, or heard ſomething of his love, but yet hath no experience thereof in his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Study thine own experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Conſider the carriage of Chriſt particularly towards thy ſoul. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how long hee bare with thee, whilſt thou waſt in the ſtate of nature, I and an enemy unto him. How long did hee ſtand <hi>knocking</hi> at the door, ere thou didſt open? How long did he come woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy ſoul, ere thou didſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him? How many ways did hee take to work upon thee, to open
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100935:115"/>thine heart to let him in, that hee might love thee? How freely did hee tender love to thy ſoul? was there any other condition, on which hee tendred himſelf to thee, than thine acceptance of him? Said he not, when he came and knocked at thy door, if thou <hi>wilt open, I will come in and ſup; and thy heart ſhall be at no coſt to prepare, I have brought that with me that ſhall feaſt thee?</hi> Said hee not, if thou doe but <hi>thinſt, come and drink,</hi> and if thy heart bee but <hi>willing, eat the good</hi> things of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and live for ever. Thus mind thoſe experiences of Chriſts acting towards thee: Remember all the Feaſts of love which hee hath given thee, and by theſe thou wilt come to <hi>ſee,</hi> how <hi>good,</hi> how kind, how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he is.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Adde prayer to all theſe.</hi> It is the choyceſt wiſdome to be wiſe in the knowledge of Chriſts love: <hi>And if you lack this wiſdome, James</hi> giveth you his advice, <hi>ask it of God,</hi> and if you ask of God a wiſe heart
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100935:116"/>in this particular, doubtleſs he will not deny thee; <hi>for he giveth liberally to thoſe that ask and upbraideth no man.</hi> Then ask of him much, Beg of him a wiſe and an underſtanding heart, to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge. Intreat God that thou mayeſt be <hi>taught of him,</hi> to know what is the love of himſelf, and of his Son. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every man that hath heard, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father, cometh to me:</hi> So eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that the Father teacheth, will quickly learn to know what is the love of Chriſt to beleevers. And that thou mayeſt bee able to know the love of Chriſt in its <hi>luſter,</hi> beg of God to beſtow upon thee <hi>his Spirit.</hi> Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>The Father will give the Spirit to him that asketh him;</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As no man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man which is in him; ſo none can know the things of Chriſt, but the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Go to the Lord Jeſus, and remember him of his <hi>promiſe:</hi> Tell him, he hath promiſed to ſend <hi>his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100935:116"/>Spirit,</hi> and that when the Spirit is come, <hi>he ſhall take of Chriſt, and ſhew it unto the Soul.</hi> Intreat him therefore to ſhew his Spirit, and intreat him alſo, that his Spirit would come with the <hi>ſhedding abroad</hi> of his love. Say, <hi>O! that the Spirit would take of thy love, and ſhed it into me; and O! that he would ſhed it abroad into mine heart, that I may be able with all Saints to comprehend the height, and the depth, and the length, and the breadth of the love of Chriſt, and that I may be able alſo to know that love which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus hinted a few words as concerning the means (how we may attain the knowledg of Chriſts love) I ſhall now adde a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>manner</hi> how we ſhould behave our ſelves in the uſe of this means, while we ſtudy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſts love; and for this take theſe directions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Be very exact.</hi> Exactneſs is requiſite in all ſtudies, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this: Gather up (O Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100935:117"/>all the <hi>crumbs</hi> and <hi>filings</hi> of this <hi>gold</hi> (Chriſts love.) When thou readeſt any thing concerning Chriſt, be exact to obſerve the ſmiles of his countenance, the words of his lips, the geſture of his hands, the turning of his eye, love doth thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them:
<q>Sic oculos, ſic ille manus, ſic ora ferebat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Obſervation was made of <hi>eyes,</hi> and of <hi>hands,</hi> and of <hi>countenance;</hi> ſo doe thou obſerve: be very curious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o ſtudy this love in all its <hi>circumſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> in all its <hi>doings,</hi> in all its <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations:</hi> If ever you would ſhew exactneſſe in any ſtudy, ſhew it in this. Doubtleſſe the exacter you are in this ſtudy, the clearer you will be able to comprehend Chriſts love.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>be loving.</hi> Thoſe know moſt of Chriſts love to them, who abound moſt in love to him: <hi>John</hi> ſeemeth to be moſt loving of all the Diſciples, and therefore hee ſeemeth to have the greateſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100935:117"/>of Chriſts love; he was ſo happy as to <hi>lean on the boſome</hi> of the Lord Jeſus; and to him was revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more than to the reſt of the Apoſtles. Look, as that man doth but in vain expect mercy of God, who is without mercy himſelf; ſo doth that ſoul in vain deſire to know Chriſts love, who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all love himſelf: you may doe well to obſerve the context, here in this 3 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>v.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that you <hi>Being rooted, and grounded in love, may bee able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the length, breadth, and depth, and height of the love of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> To be grounded in love, is an excellent way to comprehend love: And doubtleſs Chriſt will bee very kind in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of his love, to thoſe in whom hee obſerves the workings of love.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, bee very <hi>admiring in all the ſtudy;</hi> let all your reading bee mixed with admiration at every love-paſſage of Chriſt; <hi>ſit and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100935:118"/>at every word of love; <hi>ſtay, and wonder;</hi> adore the glory of that light which appeareth in any beam of love: And in the admiration of that love which doth appear, caſt thy ſelf at the feet of Chriſt, and cry out, O the depth of love in thee! O the riches of the love of thy boſome! that ſhouldeſt thus let out thy ſelf to beleevers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when thou comeſt as it were at a ſtand, and canſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the tranſcendency of this love, Imitate the Philoſopher, and caſt thy ſelf into that ſea of love, which thou wouldeſt fain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, or ſound, and art not able; Let that love comprehend thee, which thou canſt not comprehend thy ſelf: Emerge, and drown thy ſelf, in that vaſt Ocean of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours boſome, and becauſe thou art not able with any line of thine to ſound the depth, ſink thy very Soul, that it may be able to taſte that, which thy ſtudy will not help thee ſo much as to ſee.</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:100935:118"/>
            <p>I ſhall now adde but a word to ſtir you up (in the uſe of theſe <hi>means,</hi> and in this <hi>manner</hi> hinted) ſeriouſly to proſecute the ſweet ſtudy of the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I might tell you, That <hi>all the time that you ſpend in this ſtudy will be very delightful, and very profitable, and you will have no reaſon to repent thereof.</hi> Thoſe who have ſpent (or rather miſ-ſpent) their time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fine Hiſtories of feigned Loves, have at laſt been forced to confeſs their follies in ſo doing. That well-deſerving perſon, Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> is reported to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon his Death-bed, the miſ-ſpending of thoſe parts which God had given him, in the penning of that well-penned peece, his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia.</hi> But ſurely (beleevers) to lye upon a Death-bed, and to conſider, that although all thy time were (every hour thereof) ſpent in the ſtudy of Chriſts love, you will bee ſo farre from repenting of it, as that you will have juſt cauſe to rejoyce
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100935:119"/>in it. But not to urge this, doe but</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>conſider the times in which we live.</hi> How little love is there in theſe dayes! ſurely, <hi>the love of many is waxen cold,</hi> though it bee <hi>preſſed</hi> much, yet it is but little <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed;</hi> Though all pretend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the want of love, and ſeem to preſſe the exerciſe of love: Yet where is the man, that maketh it the <hi>ſweetneſſe of his life,</hi> to let others taſt <hi>the ſweetneſſe of his love?</hi> Surely while there is ſuch little love among men, it is but meet that we ſhould ſtudy the love that is in Chriſt. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>eſpecially conſider the ſweetneſſe that the knowledge of the love of Chriſt will bring to thy ſoul in any caſe.</hi> Little do you know what comfort is wrapped up in the knowledge of Chriſts love. How oft doth but a thought of this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſpirits of the fainting Saints? With what a compoſure of ſpirit is a beleeve able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100935:119"/>himſelf in any tribulation, when he knoweth, that the love of his Saviour is without knowledge? Without the knowledge of this love, nothing will bee <hi>ſweet,</hi> but with the knowledge of this love, nothing can be <hi>bitter.</hi> And this is that which we ſhall come unto, as the laſt thing obſerved from theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> to let you ſee, <hi>how efficacious the love of Chriſt is unto the ſupporting of beleevers in any tribulation.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that is but little skilled in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the face of times, may very well ſee, that theſe times wherein wee live are very ſad: Calamity lyeth upon every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and <hi>woe</hi> hath (as it were) entred upon the <hi>Stage</hi> of the World, and <hi>acts</hi> a very bloudy part, to the terrour of all, even beleevers themſelves; ſome put on black, and walk diſconſolately; yea almoſt all
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100935:120"/>the ſonnes of men are clad in mourning, as being ſenſible of the miſery under, which moſt of the world at this day groans. In theſe times therefore what can be more ſuitable to our thoughts, than to conſider of that which may ſerve to ſupport our ſpirits. It is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſuch as are weak, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to faintings, to carry about them ſome cordiall or other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them: And it ſhould bee (doubtleſſe) the wiſdome of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (who are liable alwayes to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations) to lay in ſomething which may keep them from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under theſe tribulations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Lord Jeſus, out of the riches of his mercy, hath prepared, and provided, rich, and glorious cordials to ſupport the ſouls of his: And it is our duty (eſpecially who are the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus) to help beleevers with theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, which <hi>our Lord</hi> and <hi>their Lord</hi> hath prepared: And therefore while others, forgetting not onely
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100935:121"/>the Saints, but themſelves, take leave to preſſe and urge great things (as matters of faith) upon poor ſouls (as if they had <hi>dominion over their faith.</hi>) I ſhall endeavour to imitate the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew my <hi>ſelf a helper of your Joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. ult</note> 
               <hi>than a Lord of your faith.</hi> It was this indeed which <hi>Paul</hi> was much upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the furtherance of the joy, and comfort of beleevers: And it is this which he drives at in theſe words, in the behalf of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians; for fearing leſt the newes of theſe troubles in which hee was, ſhould ſo far trouble the Epheſians, as to make them <hi>faint,</hi> he therefore <hi>boweth his knees to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to give them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the love of Chriſt: that ſo by it, their ſpirits may be kept from fainting, either at the news of his, or fear of their own tribulations; This being therefore the end why <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth to God in the behalf of the Epheſians, <hi>that they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100935:121"/>might know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> I did obſerve this Doctrine from it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the ſpiritual knowledge of the tranſcendency of Chriſts love towards his, is of ſpecial efficacy to keep our hearts from fainting under any troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you eaſily ſee both the <hi>foundation,</hi> and the <hi>proof</hi> of this point, in this place; yet that you may ſee both the clearer, let mee hint theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider it, <hi>That the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, that the Epheſiant hearts were apt to faint at their tribulations.</hi> At the 13 <hi>verſe,</hi> his deſire that they might not faint, doth clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate this, that they were apt to faint. Indeed the <hi>children of faith,</hi> are not onely prone to fear, but are apt to <hi>faint</hi> in thoſe fears.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve how upon this <hi>fear</hi> of the Apoſtle, leſt they <hi>might faint,</hi> or (if you will) upon his <hi>deſire</hi> that they might not <hi>faint,</hi> he falleth to prayer, and maketh it his <hi>requeſt to God,</hi> (whoſe alone roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100935:122"/>is to ſupport the fainting ſpirits of all the creatures) <hi>that be would be pleaſed to keep them from fainting:</hi> For (ſaith hee) <hi>for this cauſe I how my knees to the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> (that is) upon this deſire of mine, that you might not faint, I bow my knee to him, who alone is able to ſupport your ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider, that among the reſt of thoſe things which he prayeth to God for, in their behalf, that they might not faint, hee prayeth for this in the Text</hi> (as in the laſt place) <hi>that they may know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, the very <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of all that, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had prayed for (in the former verſes, in their behalf) lyeth in this laſt. And happily therefore it was that hee bringeth in this as the laſt particular, being (as it were) that <hi>laſt cordiall, which he prayed for, in their behalf, and if it had failed, hee knew not</hi> (as it were) <hi>what to ask of God for them:</hi> This is, as it were, the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100935:122"/>laſt <hi>Doſis</hi> of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> which if it help not the <hi>patient,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> is at a ſtand, and is puzled, and knoweth not what elſe to give; ſo that I ſuppoſe you may eaſily ſee, not onely the <hi>footing</hi> that this Text affords for this truth; but alſo a great, and <hi>ſolid proof</hi> of the truth thereof in it.</p>
            <p>And yet, that you may ſee this truth more clearly from this place, I will in a word ſhew you, how that the very <hi>ſpirits</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the other <hi>cordialls</hi> which hee here prayeth for, are as it were wrapped up in this, <hi>viz. The knowledge of the love of Chriſt.</hi> For conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee prayeth that they <hi>might bee ſtrengthened in the inward man by his Spirit,</hi> verſe 16. Now what is that ſtrength of the inward man by the Spirit? but <hi>that divine and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall joy which is through him.</hi> The <hi>joy of the Lord doth give ſtrength,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem. 8.10. Now it is eaſie to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the chief <hi>ground</hi> upon which the Holy Ghoſt doth <hi>build</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100935:123"/>that joy (which through him is in the hearts of beleevers) is this, <hi>viz. the ſhedding abroad of the love of Chriſt in them.</hi> Chriſt having promiſed to ſend the <hi>ſpirit as a comforter</hi> to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (he ſaith) that <hi>he (i.e.)</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) <hi>ſhall take of mine, and ſhew unto you, John</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. Now what is there in all Jeſus Chriſt, of ſweeter efficacy and power, which the ſpirit can take, and declare to beleevers, than the knowledge of his love, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
            <p>So that if the ſtrengthening of the inward man by the holy Ghoſt bee that which helps to ſupport thy ſoul from fainting: And if that working of the holy Ghoſt, bee by a creation of divine joy, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine comfort; And that bringing of comfort in the ſpirit, depends upon revealing ſomething of the heart of Chriſt to the ſoul, then it muſt needs bee, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this cordiall, lyeth in the knowledge of the love of Chriſt,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100935:123"/>which alone the Spirit is able to bring in, as it were from Chriſts heart, and ſhed it into the hearts of beleevers, for the ſtrengthening of the inward man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle doth pray, as a means to keep the <hi>Epheſians</hi> from fainting, that <hi>Chriſt may dwel in their hearts by faith, ver.</hi> 17. Now a very few thoughts will diſcover, that the ſtrength of this comfort doth lye in the knowledge of Chriſts love. For whereas the ſoul may ſay, ah! but will Chriſt dwell in my heart? I would fain beleeve it, but what ground have I for ſuch a beleef? Hee is the <hi>high</hi> and the <hi>lofty one,</hi> and I am <hi>mean</hi> and a <hi>poor creature;</hi> Hee is not only the <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his fathers glory,</hi> but the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fathers holineſſe;</hi> And will ſuch a pure perſon as hee is, come and dwell in ſuch a polluted houſe as I am? Thus the ſoul would, or might reaſon; but now all this reaſoning is quieted, and this doubting will bee eaſily reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100935:124"/>by the knowledge of Chriſts love; for hee that knoweth the love of Chriſt, knoweth how willing Chriſt is to come into the heart of a poor beleever, and how that daily and hourely hee doth ſtand at the door knocking for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
            <p>So that I ſay, the very Spirits of the other cordials, and as it were their <hi>quinteſſence,</hi> lying in this, the knowledge of the love of Chriſt,</p>
            <p>It is very plain, <hi>That the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, is of ſpeciall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy, to keep the hearts of beleevers from fainting under tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> But I ſhall a little more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this point,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>By opening wherein this knowledge of the love of Chriſt doth conſiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By ſhewing wherein the ſpeciall efficacy of that knowledge doth appear, for the ſupporting of the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from fainting fits in the time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then in the cloze of all, I
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100935:124"/>ſhall make ſome Uſe and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Wherein doth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſts love conſiſt,</hi> or what kind of knowledge of the love of Chriſt is it, which keepeth the heart from fainting?</p>
            <p>In the generall, I hinted it in that expreſſion, the <hi>ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the love of Chriſt; That is, ſuch a knowledge of Chriſts love, as the ſoul hath by the revelation of the Spirit, acting by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad of that love, even upon the ſpirit of a beleever. Look as the carnall knowledge of Chriſts perſon (<hi>the knowledge of him after the fleſh</hi> (as the Apoſtles phraſe is) is not ſaving, neither is it ſweet; So neither is the carnall knowledge of his love. It is the ſpirituall knowledge of his perſon, and the ſpirituall knowledge of his love, which furthereth the everlaſting happineſſe of a ſoul hereafter, and the ſweetneſſe, and comfort of a ſoul here.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:100935:125"/>
            <p>But more particularly, I ſhall hint two words for the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the knowledge of Chriſts love, what it is.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Negatively, <hi>It conſiſteth not in the bare notion of it.</hi> All divine knowledge (whatſoever it bee) is without any efficacy, if it bee but barely in the notion. Look as in <hi>reference to duty,</hi> knowledge is not <hi>effectually imperative,</hi> to put the ſoul upon doing, unleſſe it ſink deep into the ſoul (for the word falling among ſtones, and wanting root, did not ariſe up in fruit.) In like manner with <hi>reference unto joy,</hi> knowledge is no way <hi>efficaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative</hi> (although it bee the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſts love) unleſſe it ſink down from the head, into the hearts of beleevers. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle putteth the knowledge of the glory of God the father (as to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darknes, had ſhined into their hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. In like manner hee putteth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100935:125"/>of the knowledge of the love of God in making the ſoul patient in its waitings, (and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not fainting in his troubles) in this, that the Lord would direct the <hi>Theſſalonians hearts into the love of God; the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>direct your hearts into the love of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. wherefore then, this is the firſt thing by way of negation, (that you may know wherein the knowledge of the love of Chriſt doth not conſiſt) it is <hi>not the bare notion,</hi> or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof in the head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and poſitively, <hi>The right knowledge of the love of Chriſt, in reference to the matter in hand,</hi> I conceive chiefly doth conſiſt in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In a particular application of the love of Chriſt to the ſoul by faith, (i.e.)</hi> that the ſoul ſhould be able to lay home that to himſelf, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which he underſtandeth to be in the heart of Chriſt, to every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in generall. The ſoul ſhould bee able to ſay of the love of Chriſt, it is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100935:126"/>
               <hi>mine,</hi> for elſe (as hee ſaid) <hi>quid haec mihi, niſi mea? what is all this to me, if it bee not mine?</hi> In like manner will the ſoul ſay, what is it to mee, if there be a tranſcendent love in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Chriſt to beleevers, if I have not a ſhare in it? Look as the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word doth not profit them, <hi>in whom it is not mixed with faith (i.e.)</hi> (in the particular application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to themſelves.) In like manner, neither doth the love of Chriſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort any,</hi> if it bee not mixed with <hi>faith (i.e.)</hi> particularly applyed to their own ſouls; <hi>this is a faithfull ſaying</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of which I am chief,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the truth of the ſaying, that Chriſt <hi>came to ſave ſinners,</hi> but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the joy and comfort of <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee could ſay, <hi>I am chief.</hi> It is moſt clear, that the knowledge of the love of Chriſt is comforting, but the efficacy of it doth lye in the application: Juſt as now, how choyce ſoever the cordiall bee, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100935:126"/>is preſcribed by the Doctor, it is of no comfort to cure the patient, if it bee not taken; In like manner, though the knowledge of the love of Chriſt bee one of the choiſeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls which is revealed, yet it is of no vertue to the ſoul, unleſſe it bee taken <hi>(i.e.)</hi> particularly applyed by faith. This is the firſt thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the right knowledge of the love of Chriſt, as it is efficacious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in troubles, doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, It conſiſteth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the particular Application, but <hi>in a ſerious Meditation thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed.</hi> Application taketh the cordiall (as it were in the mouth) and lets it down into the <hi>ſtomach;</hi> But <hi>meditation ſucketh</hi> out the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>my Meditation on him ſhall bee ſweet, Pſal.</hi> 104.4. Not only the knowing, and beleeving of it to bee the ſouls, but alſo the <hi>meditation</hi> is that which maketh it more ſweet; if the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall which the patient taketh, bee never ſo ſweet, yet, if it be <hi>ſpit out</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100935:127"/>again, and not <hi>chewed</hi> (as it were) or <hi>ſwallowed</hi> down, it affords but little refreſhing: In like manner, though the love of Chriſt bee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing ſweet (yea and albeit it bee as it were applied in the generall:) If it bee not meditated upon, it will bee but of little efficacy to keep the heart from fainting. <hi>Wee will bee glad, and rejoyce in thee</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4. yea but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in would they find them joy? it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>in thy love:</hi> But how would they find out the ſweetneſſe of that joy, out of that love? it is hinted in this, <hi>I will remember thy love more than wine.</hi> The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, or the meditation upon the love of Chriſt, doth greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart of a beleever, more than wine doth the heart of any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall creature.</p>
            <p>So that this ſhall ſuffice, as to the firſt particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the declaration, wherein the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, as it is efficacious to keep the heart from fainting in troubles, doth conſiſt.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:100935:127"/>
            <p>Now in the next place wee ſhall ſhew, wherein the <hi>efficacie of ſuch a knowledge</hi> as this is (of the love of Chriſt) <hi>doth appear, for the ſupporting of fainting ſouls,</hi> and this wee ſhall ſhew in two branches.</p>
            <p>Firſt generally: The knowledge of the love of Chriſt will appear, <hi>in its effecting of five things, which are of great vertue, to bear up the heart that it faint not in any troubles,</hi> as now,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that <hi>it freeth the ſoul from thoſe doubts and fears, in which it is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its eternall condition.</hi> There is a great deal of vertue in ſuch a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as this is, to keep up the ſoul from fainting in troubles; uſually even thoſe that are faithfull, when they are in any troubles, are fearfull of their eternall eſtate, and doe much queſtion it: But when that fear is removed, and that great queſtion is reſolved, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inabled to bear up, not onely in regard of fainting under, but alſo cheerfully to goe through
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100935:128"/>all their troubles. The example of that Martyr (Mr. <hi>Glover</hi>) is famous for this; hee much doubted his condition a little before hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and there were a great many deſpondencies in his Spirit, and a great many faintings (as it were) ſo that hee did not carry himſelf ſo cheerfully as hee would; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when God was pleaſed to ſhine in with the aſſurance of his love, and to free him from this doubt, under which hee did ſaint, then was hee inabled, not only to bear out from fainting, but to go out, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, with a great deal of joy and cheerfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now it is eaſie to ſhew how the love of Chriſt ſerveth to free the ſoul from thoſe doubts in which it is, about its eternall condition. He that knoweth the tranſcendency of Chriſts love, will bee eaſily freed from doubting about his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The knowledge of Chriſts love in this reſpect <hi>caſteth out fear:</hi> And indeed the chief ground of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100935:128"/>this doubting, is the want of the knowledge of the love of Chriſt; when once the beleever is able to ſay, I know the love of Jeſus Chriſt, and I know it not onely for others, but my ſelf, then hee will bee able to reſolve, What ſhould I doubt? Or who ſhould I fear? Sith Jeſus Chriſt loveth mee with ſuch a tranſcendent love? And thus being freed from his fears, hee is alſo freed from his faintings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>An aſſurance of a rewards; after all ſufferings, and tribulations, this doth mightily ſupport the ſoul from fainting under them;</hi> therefore it was, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not faint (though hee were <hi>in afflictions with the people of God</hi>) becauſe hee was aſſured of the <hi>recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> Therefore it was that <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding his great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was kept from fainting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was aſſured of a <hi>Crown of life, which was laid up for him:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was inabled to endure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100935:129"/>fainting, becauſe <hi>of the joy that was ſet before him.</hi> Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the love of Chriſt doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and produce this aſſurance. The ſoul that knoweth how dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus Chriſt doth love him, and what tranſcendent affection hee beareth unto him, will with a little pains bee brought to beleeve, that certainly hee will fully and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reward him, for all the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations hee endureth for him. O! ſaith the beleever (that knoweth the love of Jeſus Chriſt) albeit what I <hi>feel</hi> be ſore, and what I <hi>fear</hi> be ſadder, though my tribulations bee many, yea and heavy too, yet I know I ſhall have a reward for all after all, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth mee, with a love <hi>paſſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> And thus the beleever will bee ſweetly ſupported from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>a full acquieſcence, for reſt in Chriſt, is very efficacious, to keep the ſoul from fainting under troubles.</hi> That which cauſeth the heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100935:129"/>and to bee apt to faint, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is apt to bee toſſed up and down: An unſtable ſoul, is like to the veſſell in the ſtorm without an <hi>anchor, toſſed</hi> up and down with every <hi>wave,</hi> and every <hi>wind;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that ſouls are apt to fret, and to faint, becauſe they doe not, and cannot reſt in God. Hence is that exhortation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, fret not thy ſelfe.</hi> Men do <hi>fret,</hi> and <hi>faint,</hi> becauſe they doe not <hi>reſt in the Lord:</hi> whereas if they could doe the one, they would bee free from the other. Now the <hi>knowledge of the love of Chriſt,</hi> doth bring the ſoul to ſuch a <hi>reſting and quieſcance on Chriſt.</hi> O ſaith the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, when I conſider how Chriſt loveth mee, how out of that love to mee hee will plead my cauſe for me, and will one day make thoſe by whom I now ſuffer tribulation, to come and <hi>worſhip before mee, that they may know that hee loveth mee,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 3.9. When I conſider this, ſaith the ſoul, then am I enabled quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100935:130"/>to reſt my heart in Chriſt, and to ſolace my ſoul in him, and to bee ſo far from fainting under, or fretting at my tribulations, as that I am able in my patience to poſſeſſe my ſelf, and to rejoyce in Chriſt. Thus the knowledge of the love of Chriſt worketh a reſting upon him, and that reſt keepeth from fainting.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Strength of love to Jeſus Chriſts perſon ſerveth to ſupport the ſoul from fainting under tribulations. Jacobs</hi> love to <hi>Rachel</hi> kept him from <hi>fainting,</hi> under any hardneſſe which hee did indure for her. And the <hi>ſpouſe</hi> being <hi>ſick of love to Chriſt,</hi> was made ſtrong by that ſickneſſe, to endure much for Chriſt without fainting. <hi>The Watch-men ſmite her, and wound her; the keepers of the wall take her, and abuſe her, taking away her veil from her:</hi> yet ſhee holds out, yet ſhee faints not at all this trouble, and why? becauſe ſhee was <hi>ſick of love</hi> for the Lord Jeſus: Thus ſtrength of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove to Chriſt,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100935:130"/>keepeth a ſoul from fainting under ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge of Chriſts love doth very <hi>facily,</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> work this: Hee that knoweth how tranſcendently Chriſt doth love him, cannot chuſe but at leaſt real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love Chriſt again, yea, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too. Beleevers cannot chuſe but love him, whom they know <hi>loved them firſt.</hi> Hence it is, that (Phoenix like) gathering together all the ſpicy actions of Chriſts love, and ſweetly meditating upon them, they can fetch fire out of all, and ſweetly dye in the flames of that fire, and never faint. O how eaſily can the ſoul ſupport it ſelf from fainting under tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for Chriſt, while it burneth with love to Chriſt? And how eaſie alſo is it for a ſoul not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fetch <hi>fire</hi> to kindle, but even to <hi>inflame?</hi> How alſo when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the tranſcendent love of Chriſt to him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Adde to this in the laſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100935:131"/>place this conſideration, <hi>that divine joy is ever efficacious to keep the ſoul from fainting under trouble.</hi> There is a ſtrengthening power in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy, to keep the ſouls of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from fainting fits (as was hinted in the beginning.) Now the knowledge of Chriſts love is that which is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that divine joy, and that divine joy keeping the heart from ſinking under ſadneſſe, it is eaſie to gather up this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that the knowledge of Chriſts love, is of ſpeciall efficacy for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul from fainting under troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you have ſeen in a generall way, the efficacy of the knowledge of Chriſts love, to ſupport the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from fainting in times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If you will ſee the ſumme of theſe five things reduced into one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, take it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If freedom from fear about a mans eternall condition; If aſſurance of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, after all tribulations; If reſting
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100935:131"/>upon Chriſt in a time of trouble; If ſtrength of love to Chriſt, and alſo of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine joy through the Spirit, be efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to keep the heart from fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der troubles, then the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, muſt needs be efficacious, becauſe it produceth all theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now we have ſeen that freedom of the ſoul,</hi> 1 <hi>From doubts, about the eternall condition, And</hi> 2 <hi>aſſurance of a reward after all tribulations, And</hi> 3 <hi>an acquieſcence or reſting on Chriſt in time of trouble, together with</hi> 4 <hi>ſtrength of love to Chriſt, And</hi> 5 <hi>divine joy, is ever efficacious that way,</hi> therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But now more particularly, I ſhall ſhew the <hi>efficacy of this cordiall</hi> (the knowledge of this love) <hi>to keep the heart from fainting</hi> under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In that the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, doth (eſpecially in ſuch a nature as hath been deſcribed) go to the heart, and refreſheth the Spirits of a beleever.</hi> Therefore is any thing cordiall, and refreſhing, becauſe it
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100935:132"/>goeth to the heart, and hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the Spirits. As now <hi>wine, hot water, Spirits</hi> and <hi>quinteſsences, &amp;c.</hi> doe therefore cheriſh, becauſe they warm the heart, and revive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Thus now the <hi>knowledge of the love of Chriſt, becauſe it goeth to the very heart,</hi> and reviveth the Spirits of the Saints (which if revived there is no fainting) therefore it muſt needs bee ſo efficacious as it is. As now the <hi>fear of God</hi> is moſt ſoveraign to keep from evill, becauſe (as the phraſe is) it is put into <hi>the heart;</hi> ſo likewiſe the knowledge of the love of Chriſt is moſt ſoveraign, and efficacious to ſupport from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under trouble, becauſe it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the heart, and cheareth the Spirits. Hence is that phraſe, <hi>of the ſhedding abroad the love of God in your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This knowledge of the love of Chriſt doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to bee efficacious to keep from fainting under troubles, in that it maketh <hi>the faculties of the ſoul
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100935:132"/>ſo intenſe.</hi> Intenſion maketh inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſo freeth from fainting. <hi>Saul,</hi> though hee were oppoſed, and much mocked of the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> yet being newly lifted up to the kingdome (was ſo <hi>intenſe</hi> upon that) that hee did not at all mind the ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> (much leſſe did hee faint at their fordid carriage.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.27.</note>) Some conceive that <hi>therefore</hi> men in a frenzie doe not faint at any thing (as others doe) becauſe of their intenſiveneſſe; what was it that kept the Apoſtle from fainting in affliction, but the <hi>intenſiveneſſe</hi> of his Spirit, about everlaſting and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall objects, <hi>For which cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I doe not faint, while wee look not at things which are ſeen, but things which are not ſeen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. c. 16, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo <hi>intenſe</hi> upon higher objects, that hee did not faint at his tribulations. Now the knowledge of the love of Chriſt, maketh the ſoul very <hi>intenſive</hi> in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of all its ſweet dimenſions. Thus ſaith the ſoul that knoweth
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100935:133"/>the love of Chriſt, <hi>O the height, and depth, and length of the love of Chriſt! O that ſo great a perſon as Chriſt is, ſhould love ſo mean a creature as I am! Oh that one who is not onely man, but God, ſhould ſet his heart upon mee, who am not onely a man, but a worm!</hi> And thus now being intenſe in that contemplation of Chriſts love, it is kept from fainting under tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it appeareth, that the knowledge of Chriſts love is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp;c. becauſe <hi>it maketh the ſoul to forget all the loves of men.</hi> The reaſon why we are apt to faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tribulations, is becauſe wee are apt to overprize the love of men. Did wee not ſet our hearts ſo much on the love of men, wee ſhould not faint for the want of that love. What though men (yea all the ſons of men) ſhall hate and oppoſe? ſo long as I doe not prize their love, nor fear their hatred, I ſhall never faint. Now the contemplation of the love of Chriſt to the ſoul, doth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100935:133"/>work this effect upon the heart, It maketh a man to forget all love of men. <hi>Peter</hi> forgat the earth when hee ſaw but a glimpſe of glory in the Mount. Mans glory is not ſeen, when Chriſts glory doth appear; the light of the Stars is not ſeen, when the light of the Sun doth ſhine. And while the ſoul is taken up in the meditation of the love of Chriſt, <hi>which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> hee doth not mind the loves of men, and therefore hee is free from fainting, at the want of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the efficacy of the knowledge of Chriſts love &amp;c. will appear, in that <hi>it hath a power to make a man forget all thoſe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which hee lieth under;</hi> we give wine (ſaith King <hi>Lemuel</hi>) <hi>to them that be of heavy hearts; &amp; ſtrong drink to him that is ready to periſh,</hi> Prov. 30.6. <hi>let him drink and forget his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> A ſoul that can make application, and meditation of the love of Chriſt, drinketh as it were that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100935:134"/>wine, that maketh him <hi>forget</hi> his ſorrows, and remember his troubles no more. Hence it is you ſhall have the poor beleever ſay, I was ſo taken up with the remembrance of the love of Chriſt, that I forgot I was in priſon: As <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee wrot this Epiſtle (being a priſoner at <hi>Rome</hi>) yet was ſo taken up with the love of Chriſt, as forgetting in a manner his impriſonment,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> 
               <hi>he prayeth not for himſelf, leſt hee ſhould faint at tribulations, but hee powreth out his heart that way in the behalf of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, that they might not.</hi> So that there is a divine, ſpirituall, <hi>intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power in the love of Chriſt,</hi> to cauſe a man not to mind, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the tribulations under which hee lyeth; and ſurely the ſoul doth never faint under that which it doth forget.</p>
            <p>Thus now wee have gone over the ſecond thing, and ſhewed you both generally, and particularly, wherein the power of the knowledge of the love of Chriſt (as it helps
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100935:134"/>in keeping the heart from fainting under troubles) doth conſiſt; wee will wind up all in a word of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Now</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> firſt, for <hi>Information.</hi> This point (<hi>That the knowledge of Chriſts love is of ſuch ſpeciall efficacy to keep up the heart from fainting under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>) lets us <hi>ſee what great need we have to ſtudy the love of Chriſt.</hi> Men have much ſtudied the nature of ſome <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Mineralls,</hi> becauſe they are of ſpecial uſe for <hi>cordials;</hi> you hear of what ſpeciall uſe for ſpirituall cordialls, the knowledge of the love of Chriſt is; have not you ground then to ſtudy it? <hi>Paracelſus</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all to lye within the compaſſe of his <hi>Sol, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſpentall (or moſt of) his ſtudy, in the ſearch, and knowledge of them; The love of Chriſt is the moſt <hi>catholicall cordiall;</hi> not onely including all other cordialls, but the life that the ſoul doth find in all other; Look as Gods love is put for all cauſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. when hee
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100935:135"/>gave his Son. So Chriſts love is put for all cordialls, when the Saints get comfort: <hi>Tribulation, diſtreſſe, perſecution, famin, nakedneſſe, perils, ſword,</hi> neither any, nor all theſe, can bear down, when the ſoul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the love of Chriſt that loves him. And as it is the moſt <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall cordiall,</hi> ſo it is the moſt <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall.</hi> Thoſe cordialls are of moſt efficacy, which are moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and moſt ſuiting to the Spirits; why, <hi>love is our life,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Chriſts love falls in with the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, it is moſt ſuitable to it, and therefore moſt ſovereign. Verily if there bee need of ſtudying that which may bee a cordiall to any condition, there is neceſſity of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of the love of Chriſt, which is ſuch a <hi>Catholicall,</hi> and <hi>Homogeneal</hi> cordiall as it doth ſuit with the Spirits, and as it fitteth all the troubles, that any beleever may meet withall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Doctrine ſpeaketh <hi>lamentation</hi> alſo: How ſad is it to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100935:135"/>ſee! that though this love of Chriſt bee ſuch a cordiall to beleevers in any trouble, yet either,</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, <hi>they neglect it,</hi> and make no uſe of it, ſuch is their folly, that they have this <hi>precious price in their hands,</hi> and they doe not know it, ſo as to make uſe of it; what a ſad thing is it, for the fainting man, to ſee a cordiall at the beds head, and not to uſe it?</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, in ſtead of uſing this, they <hi>uſe other cordials.</hi> Who laments not? to ſee beleevers in theſe times of trouble, one while <hi>eying coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi> another while <hi>eying Armies;</hi> and in the mean while, not <hi>eying the love of Chriſt</hi> (which alone is able to comfort, when all other things fail.) It is lamentable to ſee how beleevers leave this <hi>fountain of living comforts, and ſeek after,</hi> yea and <hi>dig for ciſternes,</hi> yea <hi>broken ciſternes,</hi> that neither have, nor can hold any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (which is worſt of all) <hi>when Chriſt offers this cordial, they put it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100935:136"/>by, and will not take it.</hi> How often doth Chriſt open his boſome to the beleever? and lets him ſee love written in the golden letters of <hi>Free grace;</hi> and beſeecheth the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to look, and live, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate it, and to take comfort from it. How often doth Chriſt ſay, Soul, I love thee, I love thee <hi>with an everlaſting love, therefore have I drawn thee</hi> into this wilderneſſe of trouble, that here I might ſpeak comfort unto thee, where none can help thee? And yet lamentable it is to hear beleevers ſaying, that they will not beleeve it, though their ſouls might bee comforted by it.</p>
            <p>Thus beleevers, this <hi>cordiall point</hi> may ſet you all a weeping, that notwithſtanding the love of Chriſt bee ſo comfortable, you <hi>uſe it not, but inſtead thereof uſe other cordialls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That when Chriſt openeth this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, you will not open your mouths widely that hee may fill them with it.</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100935:136"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Thirdly be <hi>reproved you chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of faith for this fault.</hi> Hath Chriſt provided ſuch a cordiall for you, and do you neglect it? Is there ſuch refreſhing for your ſouls in his love, and will not you uſe it? Doth hee (as it were) bring it home to your hearts, and will not you take it? <hi>be reproved for your folly</hi> (O yee of little faith) ſuppoſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould provide ſome cordiall for the weak, fainting child, and bring it to the child, beſeeching the little one to take it, that it might live; were not the child much to bee reproved, if (forgetting all the Mothers care and coſt) it ſhould put it by? It is your folly, and your blame (O beleevers) who notwithſtanding all the <hi>care</hi> (yea and the <hi>coſt</hi> of Chriſt too) in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and bringing this <hi>cordiall (his love)</hi> unto you, yet too too often you put it by, and <hi>Rachel</hi>-like, becauſe your <hi>children (creature comforts)</hi> are not, you will not bee comforted with this cordiall
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100935:137"/>of Chriſts love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Fourthly, let it bee a uſe of <hi>direction, to direct beleevers whither to go for a cordiall in time of trouble.</hi> What <hi>have you to doe with the waters of Sehor?</hi> Run you to the boſome of your Saviour; why doe you ſpend your ſelves to goe after the pudled ſtreams of creature ſweetneſſe? goe you to the running river of your Lords love, drink thereof, and bee refreſhed, and bee comforted in any caſe.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I ſaith ſome ſoul, I would goe thither</hi> (as being indeed in a ſad caſe, needing comfort) <hi>but how ſhall I doe to draw out the water of life,</hi> that is in Chriſts love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Why what is thy caſe poor heart? what is thy caſe in which thou needeſt comfort? and for which thou wouldeſt goe to Chriſts love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My caſe is ſpirituall, my ſoul <hi>is troubled within: I ſee much ſin but little grace,</hi> and this goeth to my heart, filling it with trouble; how
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100935:137"/>ſhall I improve Chriſt love in this caſe for a cordiall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that (beleever) know, <hi>Chriſt loveth thee notwithſtanding all this.</hi> I beeleeve you think that Chriſt doth not affect you, becauſe your ſinne is ſo much, and your grace is ſo little. Know ſoul, though the woman was a <hi>ſinner</hi> (in the City, and ſo full of ſin) yet Chriſts love paſſed by her ſin, and pardoned her: Chriſts love took the advantage of her many ſins, to ſhew much love to her ſoul. And it is his cuſtome, <hi>where ſins abound, there to make love ſuperabound.</hi> Therefore thou maiſt comfort thy ſelf (O ſad ſoul) with the thoughts of Chriſts love. This love made him to ſuffer for ſin, and this love maketh him every day to pardon ſin: yea and hee will ſhew the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of his love, in paſſing by the tranſcendency of ſin.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>O but I have not only much ſin, but little grace!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Bee it ſo (O beleever) yet the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100935:138"/>love of Chriſt may comfort thee notwithſtanding it. <hi>Thou thinkeſt that grace is the cauſe of love, but thou art deceived, it is the effect of love;</hi> Chriſt loveth not becauſe there is grace; but becauſe hee loveth, hee giveth grace. Grace is given in a time of love; Love is not ſhewn becauſe of grace; therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf (O beleeving ſoul) at the conſideration of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Chriſts love. It is the glory thereof, that it <hi>pardoneth much ſin,</hi> and that is <hi>loveth little grace;</hi> and it will work ſo, that in time <hi>ſin ſhall bee little,</hi> and <hi>grace much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> O but ſaith the poor ſoul, <hi>I have loſt Chriſt.</hi> I think there was a day, in which I ſaw, that his love was my life, and the conſideration thereof was my comfort; but I have loſt the one, and ſo cannot ſolace my ſelf in the other.</p>
            <p>A. Why <hi>yet (beleever) the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts love, may bee a choice cordiall here.</hi> Didſt thou conſider the <hi>very nature</hi> of Chriſts love aright,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100935:138"/>thou wilt know this to bee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, that <hi>once had, it can never bee loſt.</hi> It may bee the Sun may bee in a cloud, and thou not ſee it, but it will appear again: But the Sun ſhall ſooner leave the Firmament, than Chriſts love ſhall leave thee: Didſt thou but alſo <hi>conſider the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Chriſts love,</hi> thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt know, that though Chriſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to withdraw himſelf a while, yet his love will not permit his withdrawing to bee long; <hi>yet a little while, and you ſhall not ſee mee:</hi> (It is but a little while that Chriſt is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly loſt) <hi>and yet a little while, and you ſhall ſee mee again.</hi> Chriſt knoweth your Spirits would faile, if hee ſhould bee long away: Love therefore looks to it, that it ſhall never bee ſo long, as in the loſſe thereof thou ſhouldeſt faint, and dye. Didſt thou know the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent nature of Chriſts love, thou wouldeſt know this, that though thou mayeſt faint a little, yet thou ſhalt not dye: Love will
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100935:139"/>come and revive thee; yea didſt thou but conſider the love of Chriſt aright, it will bee a cordial in other particulars alſo, in that it maketh a large amends for a little tarrying; for a <hi>moments</hi> withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it lets out <hi>everlaſting kindneſſe,</hi> and it therefore departed for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that thou mighteſt have it for ever</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O.b.</hi> O but ſaith the ſoul, I faint to <hi>think that I have loſt Chriſt through mine own defect:</hi> I have been ſo baſe as to drive him out of my boſome; and I faint to think that hee will never come again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Why (poor ſoul) <hi>thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the nature of Chriſts tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love:</hi> Couldeſt thou but know it, thou wouldeſt eaſily reſolve thy ſoul in this caſe, and ſupport it with a ſweet cordial: ſuch is the <hi>nature</hi> of tranſcendent love, that <hi>though you have been fooliſh to drive Chriſt away, yet it is ſo powerfull to bring Chriſt again.</hi> It was the folly and the fault of the ſpouſe, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100935:139"/>though her beloved was knocking at her door, till his <hi>locks were wet with the dew of the night,</hi> yet ſhe ſluggiſhly lay in her bed, and would not let him in: Indeed <hi>hee went away,</hi> that ſhee might ſee her folly, but hee <hi>came again,</hi> that hee might ſhew loves tranſcendency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Nay ſaith the ſoul, with all this, <hi>I have violated and wronged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall love;</hi> and the thoughts of theſe ſink my Spirit: I faint and dye to think of this, for fear that Chriſt will not paſſe by theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still I ſay <hi>(beleever didſt thou but know the nature of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love of Chriſt,</hi> it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee a cordial in this caſe alſo: This is the glory of this love, that it paſſeth by ſuch violations. Indeed the love of men will not, but the love of Chriſt will paſſe by this foul tranſgreſſion, becauſe that Chriſts love tranſcendeth mens love. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet return to mee,</hi> Jerem. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and ſurely (ſaith hee) <hi>as a wife
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100935:140"/>treacherouſly departeth from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſo have you dealt with mee, O houſe of Iſrael, yet return you back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding people, and I will heal your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings:</hi> O tranſcendent love! which is in Chriſts boſome, which knoweth how to pardon the defilement of the bed of love. Indeed there is no failing ſo great, but didſt thou know the tranſcendency of Chriſts love, thou wouldeſt ſee it to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than any failing of thine can conquer, ſo that now in caſe this fear ſhould bee able to diſturbe thy comfort, and to make thee faint, yet the conſideration of Chriſts love may ſupport thy ſoul, and bee a cordial unto thee, even in this caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But yet I hear others cry out, and ſay, <hi>how ſhall wee doe to draw out joy, out of this well of ſalvation.</hi> How ſhall wee make the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts love, a cordial to us in our troubles?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why? <hi>what are your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> (poor ſouls) which make you
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100935:140"/>ſtand in need of the comfort of this conſideration?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have <hi>loſt much, nay all, for Chriſt,</hi> becauſe I ſtood to his cauſe; I have loſt all the creatures, lands, and livings too, yea, and houſe, and houſhold too, &amp;c. I have loſt all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But yet conſider Chriſts love, and it will comfort thee in the middeſt of this loſſe: <hi>It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of tranſcendent love, to repair all loſſes, &amp; that double; in your land,</hi> you ſhall poſſeſs <hi>double Iſa.</hi> 61.17. And <hi>there is no man that hath left for Chriſt Parents, Brethren, houſe, or children, but love will make up all that,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Tranſcendent love, ſcorns to let any bee a loſer by it. May not this comfort thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> O but ſaith another, I have not onely loſt all, but am <hi>ſtill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> they have ſtripped mee to my change for Chriſts ſake, and yet <hi>oppoſe my very skin:</hi> How ſhall I comfort my ſelf with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts love now?</p>
            <pb n="352" facs="tcp:100935:141"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Why thus (poor ſoul) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Chriſt will comfort as faſt as men oppoſe;</hi> tranſcendent love giveth the ſoul anſwerable conſolation to any tribulation in which the ſoul can bee. <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but bee of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and in mee you ſhall have peace.</hi> Tranſcendent love giveth a <hi>ſmile</hi> for every <hi>frown,</hi> a <hi>kiſſe</hi> for every <hi>buffet,</hi> an <hi>imbrace</hi> for every <hi>blow;</hi> this is the nature thereof, conſider it, and bee of good comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> O but ſaith the ſoul I have not onely loſt all, and been ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the change, but am brought to <hi>the ſtake,</hi> how ſhall I fetch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of Chriſts love now?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Conſider thou (dying ſoul) Chriſts love hath provided a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for it; It ſaith, you <hi>ſhall have your life by thus loſing</hi> of it; You are in the way to ſecure your life; by this you ſhall <hi>not dye, but live;</hi> thus ſaith tranſcendent love, <hi>becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo,</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:100935:141"/>Joh. 14. <hi>v.</hi> 19. After one blaſt, into Chriſts boſome; It is but a wink with the eye, and into the land of the living preſently.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee whither to goe for comfort in any tribulation, <hi>viz.</hi> to Chriſts boſome, and there you may find in his love, a cordial ſuitable to any tribulations, whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or without, ſpirituall or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Be directed therefore upon all occaſions, O you beleevers, to run to Chriſts love, and to comfort your ſelves in the conſideration thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Fifthly, it may bee an uſe of <hi>Terror to Chriſtleſſe creatures:</hi> you hear the conſideration of Chriſts love is a cordial, able to ſupport in any trouble; but <hi>wretches that you are, you</hi> have no right to it; <hi>tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for every ſoul that ſinneth,</hi> Rom. 2.9. you will meet with tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Chriſtleſſe creatures;</hi> ere long, divine wrath will come and viſit you ſurely; <hi>and what wil you doe in the day of the viſitation thereof?</hi> Whither
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100935:142"/>wll you runne for conſolation in the hour of your trouble? Will you runne to men, alas! <hi>miſerable comforters</hi> will they bee, and ſo thou wilt find them to bee: <hi>Men of a high degree are vanity, and men of a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are a lye.</hi> Whither will you go in the anguiſh of your ſouls for a drop of ſweetneſſe? Will you goe to duties? alas, without Chriſt they are but dry! and you that are Chriſtleſſe, will not know how to manage duties, ſo as to ſuck com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort through them. Wil you ſay you are in Chriſt? the Scriptures will confute you; you are told, <hi>but if any bee in Chriſt, hee is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Do not ſay, I am <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed;</hi> Many are <hi>baptiſed into Chriſts name,</hi> who are not <hi>baptiſed into his perſon;</hi> you will ſay, you have heard him <hi>preaching in your ſtreets,</hi> that you have <hi>eat</hi> in his <hi>preſence</hi> (been as you ſay, at the Sacrament) alas poor creatures! all this may bee, and yet you have no right to Chriſt. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore you Chriſtleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100935:142"/>his love is the cordial in trouble, the conſideration thereof may ſupport the ſoul from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any tribulation; but woe to you! woe to you! you have no part in that; what will you doe? what will become of you when Chriſt ſhall appear in wrath? It will bee in vain for you to call to the mountains, to hide you from the wrath of the Lamb: It will bee in vain for you to think upon the creatures, nothing, nothing, will bee able to ſupport <hi>your ſouls. Indeed, beleevers</hi> (when hee ſhall appear in <hi>flames of fire</hi>) will bee able to comfort themſelves, with the knowledge of his tranſcendent love; but alas, you who have no right to Chriſt, what will you doe in that day? you muſt doubteſſe (if you remain as you are) ſink in deſpair, and dye under his wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Laſtly, I ſhall adde one <hi>word of exhortation,</hi> and conclude: In as much as the knowledge of the love of Chriſt is of ſuch ſpeciall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100935:143"/>(as you have heard) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your ſouls under tribulations, then bee exhorted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to <hi>labour to be wel acquainted with the love of Chriſt in the ſubſtance thereof, in the circumſtances thereof, and eſpecially in the fulneſſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof.</hi> Read, ſtudy, pray, doe what you can, that you may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this love; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſideration of which, is a cordial in any trouble.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>labour to clear it up to your ſelves, that you have a ſhare in this love, and a right to it.</hi> This is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial of this cordial of Chriſts love, <hi>viz.</hi> for the ſoul to ſee that it is this; ſo much I hinted in the explication thereof: Eſpecially ſtrive (poor ſouls) to clear up this; know, you once had no part in it, you were born <hi>children of wrath, without Chriſt;</hi> Let it bee your conſtant care therefore to make it appear, that now you have a ſhare in that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love which is in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>upon all occaſions run to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100935:143"/>this fountain of love.</hi> Draw out of it ſuitable Cordials for any troubles. You have heard that it will comfort (and a word was hinted to direct you.) Now, <hi>up, and bee doing;</hi> and in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, labour that the love of Chriſt may keep your Spirits from fainting.</p>
            <p>Conſider what times you are fallen in, you may expect to meet with tribulation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure you, of ſweet, and loving dealing from the world; neither can I aſſure you of kind dealing from thoſe who call themſelves by the name of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: But this I can aſſure you, <hi>If upon the words of grace you act faith, and come to Chriſt,</hi> that hee will ſweeten your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>You have heard, <hi>There is love in his boſome for every beleever, and that love is of a tranſcendent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have alſo heard how
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100935:144"/>that, <hi>It concerneth you all to labour, and ſtudy for the knowledge of it:</hi> And now you hear, <hi>That if you attain the right and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge thereof, it will bee very comfortable to you in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, as you prize your ſoules, as you prize comfort in tribulations, Beleeve, and labour to get a part in Chriſt; and then know, that let your condition bee what it will bee, however the World ſhall goe well or ill with you, yet you ſhall ſtill find a Friend of Chriſt, hee will ſtill follow you, with a <hi>full,</hi> a <hi>free,</hi> a <hi>cordial,</hi> and a <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no more but this: Let the conſideration of the love that is in Chriſt to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that is in that love in any troubles, prevaile with you to look after it, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100935:144"/>to lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Then ſhall you know experimentally That the love of Chriſt paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
